CHAPTER 1
My first account, glorious Theophilus, I wrote about all the things that Jesus started to do and to teach, 2 until the day when he was taken up, after he gave commands to the apostles that he chose. 2 To them he also showed himself alive with many signs after he suffered, being seen by them through forty days, making known the things that concern God's kingdom. 4 And at his meetings with them he gave them the commands: “Do not go away from Jerusalem, but remain, waiting for that [ta-n] about which the Father gave his promise, and about which you heard from me. 5 For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit not many days from now.”
	Now when they were assembled, they asked him: “Lord, do you renew the kingdom for Israel at this time?” 7 He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times and moments which the Father has placed in his own power, 8 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit shall come to you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and the entire Judea and Samaria alike, and to the farthest part of the earth.”
	9 And after he said these things, while they were watching, he was being lifted up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes [dual]. 10 And while they looked up into heaven when he went away, behold! two men in white garments stood by them, 11 and they [dual] said: “Men from Galilee, how is [it] that you are standing looking at heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into the cloud, shall return so, in the same manner that you watched him go into heaven.”
	Then they went back into Jerusalem from the mountain called Mount of Olives, which is near to Jerusalem, around a sabbath's journey away. 13 Then, after going inside, they went up into the upper hall where they dwelt, Peter and John and Jacob and Andrew, Philip and Thomas and Matthew, Jacob son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zelot, and Judas son of Jacob. 14 All among them were steadfast in prayer, with some women and Mary mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
	15 Now in those days Peter arose out of the middle of the brothers – the crowd was around hundred and twenty persons – and said: “Men, brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be made true, that which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand through David's mouth about Judas, who showed the way for those that seized Jesus. 17 For he was counted among us and received a part in this ministry.” 18 (This man got a field for the reward of unrighteousness, and falling with a headlong movement he burst in the middle, and all his entrails poured out of him. 19 That became known to all that dwelt in Jerusalem, and therefore that field was called in their tongue Aceldama, which means: Field of Blood.)
	20 “For [it] has been written in the Book of Psalms: 'May his home be empty, and may no one live there', and: 'His place of oversight let another take.' 21 Therefore it is necessary for us to choose one of the men that came together with us through[out] the entire time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out [ettenna, to outside] among us, 22 from the beginning when John was baptizing and until the day when he was received up from us. For a person among them it is necessary to be a witness with us about his resurrection.”
	23 And they led forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who had the nickname Justus, and Matthias. 24 And they prayed and said: “You, Lord who know the hearts of all, make known who you have chosen 25 to receive the ministry and place as apostle which Judas abandoned to go to his own place.” 26 And they threw lots about them, and the lot indicated Matthias, and he was counted among the eleven apostles.
CHAPTER 2 
When the day of the festival of Seven Weeks was come, they were all together in one place, 2 and suddenly [rincinen, lit. 'with a sudden move'] [there] came from heaven a noice as of a blowing violent wind, and they filled the entire house in which they were. 3 And tongues as of fire being distributed appeared to them, and it settled [lit. sat down] on everyone among them. 4 Then all among them were filled with Holy Spirit and began to speak in various tongues, as the Spirit gave to them to talk.
	5 And [there] were in Jerusalem Jews dwelling there, pious men, from every country under heaven. 6 Thus, when this noise occurred, the host assembled and was confused, for everyone aming them heard them speak in his own tongue. 7 They were startled and in wonder, saying: “Behold, all these people that are speaking are from Galilee, no?
8 And yet how is [it] that we are hearing, everyone among us, his own tongue that we are born in? 9 People from Parthea ar Media and Elam, people that dwell in Mesopotamia, Judea and Capadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10 and Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the regions of Libya, near to Cyrene, and [those] that have come from Rome, Jews and converted ones alike, 10 people from Crete and Arabia – we are hearing them speak in our own tongues about God's great deeds!” 12 They were beside themselves with wonder and understood nothing, saying one to the other: “What is this thing?” 13 But others, in mockery against them, said: “They are full of sweet wine!”
	But Peter arose with the twelve and raised his voice and said to them: “Men from Judea and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, may this be known to you, and listen to my sayings: 15 These men are not full of wine as you suppose, for this is the third hour of the day. 16 On the contrary, this is [that] which was spoken though Joel the Prophet: 17 'And in the last days,' God says, 'I will pour [some] of my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will speak like prophets, and your young men will see visions, and  your old men will dream dreams [lit. for your old men [it] will be dreamt with dreams], 18 and also upon my male and female thralls I shall pour [some] of my spirit in those days, and they will speak as prophets. 19 And I will give signs in heaven above you and portents on earth below, blood and fire and mist of smoke; 20 The Sun will become darkness and the Moon will become blood, before the Lord's great and mighty day shall come. 21 And everyone who calls upon [or 'by', -nen] the Lord's name will be saved.
	22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus from Nazareth, a man that God put before you with mighty deeds and signs and portents which God did by him in your midst, as you know, 23 this man, as a person given over, by God's firm plan and the knowledge that he had beforehand, you fastened on a cross by the hand of lawless ones and killed him. 24 But God raised him by loosening the bonds of death, for it was not possible for death to keep him. 25 For David says concerning him: 'I always saw the Lord before my eyes, for he is by my right hand, to stop me from being shaken. 26 Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue spoke about great joy. Furthermore, also my flesh will dwell in hope, 27 for you will not abandon my soul in Mandos [/Hades], also you will not allow your faithful one to see a corrupt state. 28 You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy from your face.'
	29 Men, brothers, it is me allowed to speak freely to you about the patriarch David, that he expired and was brought to his grave, and his tomb is among us until this day. 30 Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God gave him a promise about placing on his throne a person of the fruit of his loins, 31 he had foresight and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned in Mandos [= Hades]; furthermore, his flesh did not see a corrupt state. 32 This Jesus God resurrected, about which [fact] all among us are witnesses. 33 Therefore, since he was raised to God's right hand and received the Holy Spirit from his Father by the promise he [= the Father] had given, he poured forth this that you are seeing and you are hearing. 34 For David did not ascend to heaven, but he himself says: 'The Lord said to my lord: Sit by my right hand, 35 until I shall place your enemies as a support for your feet.' 36 Therefore may the entire kin of Israel know that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus that you crucified.”
	37 When they heard that they were cut in their heart, and they said to Peter and to the other apostles: “Men, brothers, what are we to do?” 38 Peter said to them: “Find repentance, and may everyone among you be baptized by the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of Holy Spirit. 39 For for you is the promise, and for your children and for [those] that are far away – all that the Lord our God will call to himself.” 40 And with many other words he witnessed for them and urged them, saying: “Be saved from this perverse generation!” 41 Therefore [those] that received his word were baptized, and on that day around three thousand souls were added. 42 And they were steadfast in the teaching of the apostles and the brotherhood, in the breaking of the bread and in the prayers. 
	43 Fear fell upon everyone, and numerous wonders and signs happened through the apostles. 44 All that believed were together in having everything common, 45 and they sold their goods and the fields that they possessed and distributed the money to all, by anyone's need. 46 And 
day after day they were in the temple, being of one mind, and they broke bread in the houses, eating their food in joy and having a pure heart, 47 praising God and having the grace [or, good will] of the entire people, while every day the Lord was adding to them [those] that were saved.
CHAPTER 3
Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. 2 And a man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried thither, and they put him every day beside the gate of the temple that was called the Beautiful, for him to ask gifts of mercy from those that were going into the temple.
3 When he saw Peter and John going towards the temple, he asked from them gifts of mercy. 4 But Peter, with John, looked at him and said: “Look at us!” 5 Therefore he fixed his eyes on them, thinking that he was going to [Q: will] receive something from them. 6 But Peter said: “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have I give to you: By the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!” 7 And he seized him in his right hand and raised him up. In the same moment his soles [dual] and the joints between foot and leg became firm, 8 and he jumped up and walked, and he went with them into the temple, walking and jumping and praising God. 9 And the entire people saw him walking and praising God. 10 Furthermore, they knew who he was, that he was the man who beforehand sat to receive gifts of mercy by the Fair Gate in the temple, and they were filled with wonder and were beside themselves by [that] which had happened to him.
11 When the man stuck to Peter and John, the entire people, being startled, ran together to them in the place called the Columnade of Solomon.  12 Seeing that, Peter said to the people: “Men of Israel, how is [it] that you are in wonder about this, and what is your reason for looking at us as if by our own power or by our godliness we have caused him to walk? 13 The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has made Jesus his servant glorious, him that you gave over and denied before the face of Pilate, though he wanted to free him. 14 You denied the holy and just [one], and you requested that you were to receive a man who was a murderer, 15 but you killed the Chief of life. But God raised him from [the] dead, of which all among us are witnesses. 16 Therefore, by our faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, him whom you look at and whom you know, and the faith which is through him has given him health before your eyes. 
17 And now, brothers, I know that you did so in lack of knowledge, as your rulers also did. 18 But thus God has made true the things that beforehand he made known through the mouth of all his heralds [= prophets]: that his Christ was going to suffer.
	19 Therefore find repentence and turn yourselves [around]! Then your sins will be wiped away, allowing times of refreshment to come from the face of the Lord. 20 Thus he will send the Christ appointed to you, Jesus, 21 whom it is necessary for heaven to keep until the times of renewal of all things, of which God spoke by the mouth of his holy heralds [/prophets], of old. 22 Indeed Moses said: “The Lord your God will raise [up] among your brothers, like me.
23 Indeed every person who does to listen to that prophet will be destroyed from his people.” 24 And all the prophets, from Samuel to those that followed him – all that have spoken – have also made known these days. 25 You are sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God established with your fathers, saying to Abraham: 'And in your seed all the families of earth will be blessed.' 26 After God raised his Son, to you he first sent him to bless you, by turning everyone away from your wicked deeds.”
CHAPTER 4
While they [dual] talked to the people, the chief priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them, 2 being angry since they instructed the people and made know the resurrection from the dead by Jesus. 3 And they [plural] put their hands on them [dual] and put them in gaol until the following day, for evening had come.
	4 But numerous ones among [those] that heard the word believed. And the number of the men rose as far [or, high] as five thousands.
	5 It happened [lit. came] on the following day that the rulers and the elders and the scribes in Jerusalem assembled, 6 with Annas the chief priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all that were of the kin of the chief priest. 7 After putting them in their midst they asked: “By what power and by whose name did you [dual] do this thing?” 8 Then Peter, full of Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers of the people and elders, 9 if we [dual exclusive] are on this day investigated about a good deed to an ailing man, and you want to know by whom this man has received his health, 10 may it be known to all among you and to the entire people of Israel that it happened by the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, whom you crucified but God raised out of [the] dead. By him this man is standing here before you in health. 
11 This is the rock which was counted as nothing by you that built, which has been made the head of the corner. 12 For [there] is no salvation by anyone else, for also there is not [/neither is there] given [any] other name by which it is necessary for us to be saved.” 
	13 When they saw how freely Peter and John spoke, and knew that they [dual] were unlettered and ordinary men, they were filled with wonder, since they also knew them as people that were with Jesus. 14 When they [pl.] saw the man that stood with them [dual], he who received health, they [pl.] had nothing to say against them [dual]. 15 Therefore, after commanding them to go out from the council, they made a consideration together, 16 saying: “What are we to do to these men? For a sign which people know [about] has happened through them, easy to see to all that dwell in Jerusalem, and it is not possible for us to deny it. 17 But to stop it from being spread more widely in the people, let us rebuke them [dual], that they are not to speak more by this name to anyone.”
18 And after calling them they commanded them that it was necessary for them to completely cease to speak and teach by the name of Jesus. 19 But in answer Peter said to them: “If [/whether] it is just in God's eyes to listen to you and not to God, you judge for yourselves! 20 But we [dual] cannot cease to speak about [the things] that we have seen and we have heard.” 21 After they [pl.] spoke more to them [dual] with sharp words they released them, since they [pl.] did not find a reason for punishing them [dual], and by reason of the people, for all among them gave glory to God about [that] which had happened. 22 For the man on which this sign of healing had happened had [an age of] more than forty years. 
23 And after they [dual] were released they went to their [dual] own and told them about the things which the chief priests and elders had said to them [dual]. 24  Hearing that, with one mind they raised their voice to God and said: “Master, you are [the one] who made heaven and earth and [the things] that are exist in them [dual], 25 and who by Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David our father, your servant: 'How is [it] that nations rise up up and peoples are thinking about empty things? 26 The kings of earth have taken stand and the rulers have assembled as one, against the Lord and against his Christ.' 27 For indeed they assembled in this city, Herod and Pontius Pilate and people of the nations, against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, 28 to do [the things] that by your hand and by your choice you have beforehand established were going to happen. 29 And now, Lord, notice their threats, and allow your servants to speak your word with all boldness, 30 when you reach out with your hand to heal, and when signs and portents happen by the name of your holy servant, Jesus.
31 And after they said the request, the place where they were assembled was being shaken, and everyone among them was filled by the Holy Spirit and spoke God's word with boldness.
	32 Furthermore, the multitude of those that believed had one mind and spirit, and no one among them said about anything that he had that that was his own, but they possessed all things in common [uo: together]. 33 And with great power the apostles gave out their witness about the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and great grace lay upon all among them. 34 Indeed [there] was no one having need among them, for all that had fields or houses sold them and brought the money that they got for the sold things 35 and put that before the feet of the apostles. Then one distributed to everyone was their need was. 36 Thus Joseph, who from the apostles received the nickname Barsabba – which means Son of Comfort – one of the Levites, born at Cyprus, 37 who had a field, sold it and brought the money and put it before the feet of the apostles.
CHAPTER 5
But a man whose name was Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a field that he had 2 and secretly kept a part of the money that he got, as his wife also knew. He brought only a part and put it before the feet of the apostles. 3 But Peter said: “Ananias, how is [it] that Satan has given you boldness to lie to the Holy Spirit and put away for yourself a part of the money that you got for the field? 4 While you possessed it, was it not your own? And after it was sold, could you not still choose what you were going to do? What is your reason for doing such a deed? You have lied, not to men, but to God!” 5 When he heard these words, Ananias fell down and expired. And a great fear came upon all that heard it. 6 But the young men rose up, wrapped him in clothes, and carried him outside to his grave.
	7 After three hours his wife came inside, not knowing [that] which had happened. 8 Peter said to her: “Tell me, did you [dual] sell the field for this sum?” She said: “Yes, that was the sum.” 9 But Peter said to her: “How is [it] that you [dual] were of one mind to test the Lord's spirit? Behold! The feet [dual] of [those] that brought your husband to his grave are [dual] before the door, and they [pl.] will carry you outside.” 10 In the same moment she fell down before Peter's feet [dual] and expired. Whent he young men came inside, they found her dead, and they carried her outside and gave her a grave beside her husband. 11 Therefore great fear came upon the entire congregation and upon all that heard about these things.
	12 Furthermore, through the hands [dual] of the apostles numerous signs and portents happened among the people, and all among them assembled in Solomon's columnade, being of one mind. 13 No one of the others dared to join himself to them, and yet the people praised them.
14 Furthermore, persons that belived in the Lord were added, multitudes of men [ner-li > nelli] and women alike. 15 Therefore they brought the sick ones outside and put them there on small beds and on biers, wishing only that Peter, when he passed by, was going to [Q: will] cast shadow on some people among them. 16 And the multitude from the cities surrounding Jerusalem assembled, carrying sick ones and [those] that were being tormented by unclean spirits, and everyone among them was healed.
	17 But the chief priest and [those] that were with him, the order of the Sadducees that existed then, arose and were filled with envy, 18 and they laid hands [dual] upon the apostles and put them in the city gaol. 19 But in the night the Lord's angel opened the gates of the gaol, brought them outside and said: 20 “Go, and standing in the temple speak to the people all the sayings about this life!” 21 After they heard that, they went at dawn into the temple and taught.
	When the chief priest and [those] that were with him came, they assembled the High Council and the entire council of the sons of Israel, and they sent them to the gaol to bring them. 22 But when the officers came thither, they did not find them in the gaol. After returning they told: 23 “The gaol we found shut with all security, and the guards standing by the doors, but when we opened the gaol we did not find anyone on the inside.” 24 When the captain of the temple and the chief priest alike heard these words, they were uncertain about these things and about what was going to happen because of [-nen] this matter. 25 But a man came and told them: “Behold! The men that you put in the gaol are in the temple, standing and instructing the people!” 26 Then the captain went away with his officers and brought them, but without violence, since they feared [Q; feared from] that the peope would [Q; will] kill them with stones.
27 They brought them and put them before the High Council. And the chief priest said: “We gave you the command: Cease to teach in this name! And yet, behold! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to bring this man's blood upon us!” 29 In answer Peter and the other apostles said: “It is necessary for us to follow God's commands over those of men. 30 The God of your fathers raised [up] Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. 31 God raised him to his right hand as Chief and Saviour, in order to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are witnesses about these matters, as is the Holy Spirit, that God gave to [those] that listen to his commands.”
	33 When they heard that, they felt wounded and wished to kill them. 34 But [there] was a man who arose in the High Council, a Pharisee whose name was Gamaliel, a law-teacher dear to the entire people. He commanded: “Lead the men to the outside for a short time.”
35 Then he said to them: “Men of Israel, give heed to yourselves concerning what you want to do to these men. 36 For before these days Theudas arose, saying that he was important, and a number of men, around four hundred, went with him. But he was slain, and all that heeded his commands were scattered and undone. 37 After him Judas from Galilee arose, in the days in which the people was counted, and he drew away some people after himself. And yet that man died, and all that heeded his commands were scattered. 38 And as things stand now, I say to you: Let these men be and do not trouble them, for if this matter or things doing is from men, it will be undone, 39 but if it is from God, you will not be able to undo them. Watch yourselves, that you will not be found fighting against God!”
40 Then they gave heed to what he said. After summoning the apostles they flayed them and commanded them: “Do not speak in the name of Jesus!” Then they allowed them to go.
	41 They, therefore, went away from the High Council in joy, since they were counted worthy to suffer mockery for the sake of the name. 42 And every day, in the temple and in the houses, they did not cease to make known the gospel about Jesus Christ.
CHAPTER 6
But in those days, while the number of disciples rose, the Hellenists were grumbling against the Hebrews, since their widows were not heeded in the daily distribution. 2 Therefore the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples to themselves and said: “It is not good for us to abandon God's word to distribute food at the tables. 3 Therefore, brothers, seek among yourselves seven men that have good witness, full of spirit and wisdom, and we will set them to cover this need, 4 but we will still give yourselves to the praying and to the service of the Word.”
5 And what they said seemed good to the entire multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of Holy Spirit, and Philip and Procorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch, 6 and they put them before the apostles, and after praying they placed their hands on them.
	7 And God's word grew, and the number of the disciples rose quickly in Jerusalem, and a huge crowd of priests subjected themseves [lit. put themselves under] the faith.
	8 But Stephen, full of grace and of power, made mighty signs and portents among the people. 9 But [there] arose some men from the synagogue called [the synagogue] of [the] Freed Ones, and some people that came from Cyrene and Alexandria, to quarrel with Stephen. 10 But they  could not stand against the wisdom and the spirit with which he talked. 11 Then secretly they made some men say: “We have heard him speak blasphemies against Moses and God.”
12 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they fell upon him and seized him, and they brought him into the High Council. 13 And they called lying witnesses, that said: “This man does not cease to speak words against this holy place and against the Law. 14 And we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will throw down this place and will change the customs that we have received from Moses.”
	15 And when all that were sitting in the High Council looked at him, they saw that his face was like an angel's face.
CHAPTER 7
But the chief priest said: “Are these matters so?” 2 He said: “Men, brothers and fathers, hear! The God of Glory showed himself to Abraham our father while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, 3 and he said to him: 'Go away from your land and from your kin and come to the place that I will show you.'
4 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God caused him to move to this land in which you now dwell. 5 And yet he did not give him an heir's part in it, also [/even]not the earth under his foot-sole, but he gave him the promise that he was going to give it to him for him to possess it, and after him to his seed, while he still lacked [any] child. 6 Futhermore, this God said, that his seed was going to dwell like exiles in a foreign nation [or, land/country], and the people were going to make them thralls and were going to cause them affliction, through[out] four hundred years. 7 And 'the country [/nation] for which they will be thralls I shall judge,' said God, 'and thereafter they will go forth and will do service [núromolie: servant-work] for me in this place.' 8 And he gave him a covenant of circumcision, and thus he begat Isaac and circumcized him on the eight day, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve family heads [nossetúri: kin-rulers].
9 And the family heads, full of envy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him, 10 and he delivered him out of all his tribulations and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he put him [in office] to rule Egypt and his entire house. 11 But famine came upon he entire land of Egypt and Canaan, indeed a great tribulation, and our fathers did not find food. 12 But Jacob heard that [there] was food in Egypt, and he sent our fathers the first time. 13 And at the second time Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and Jospeh's kin was made known to Pharaoh. 14 Sending a message, Joseph summoned Jacob his father and all his kin, seventy-five people. 15 Jacob went down into Egypt. And he expired, as did our fathers, 16 and they were brought to Shechem and were put in the tomb that Abraham got from the sons of Hamor for a sum of silver [or, money].
	17 When the time came near for the promise which God made known to Abraham, the people grew and rose to a great number in Egypt, 18 until another king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 19 He used cunning against our fathers and did evil do them, compelling them to put their babies out, for them to die. 20 At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God, and he was kept for [ter = through] three months in his father's house. 21 But when he was put outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and raised him as her own son. 22 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of Egypt, and he was mighty in his words and his deeds.
	23 When he had [an age of] forty years, [it] came into his heart that he would look to his brothers, the sons of Israel. 24 And when he saw a man who suffered injustice, he protected him and gave revenge to the one that suffered violence, by striking down the Egyptian.
22 He supposed that his brothers were going to understand that God would [Q: will] give them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand it. 26 And on the following day he came to them while they fought, and he tried again to bring them together in peace, saying: 'Men, you are brothers! How is [it] that you do injustice one to the other?' 27 But [he] who was injust [unfair, behaving wrong] to his neighbor pushed him away, saying: 'Who made you chief and judge over us [dual]? 28 Perhaps you intend to kill me, like you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' 29 Because of this word Moses ran away and dwelt in the land of Midian, where two sons were born to him.
	30 And when forty years were gone, an angel showed himself to him in the wilderness by Mount Sinai, in the fiery flame of a thorn-bush. 31 When Moses saw it, what he saw filled him with wonder. But when he went near to examine [it], the Lord's voice came: 32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaak and Jacob.' Then trembling seized Moses, and he did not dare to examine [any] further [ambe = more]. 
33 The Lord said to him: 'Take your shoes from [/off] your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground. 34 I have indeed seen the evil done to my people in Egypt, and I have heard their moaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.' 35 This Moses that they turned away, saying: 'Who made you chief or judge?', this man God sent as chief and deliverer alike, by the hand of the angel that showed himself to him in the thornbush. 36 This man led them out after he did signs and portents in Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for [ter = through] forty years.
	37 Thus Moses spoke to the Sons of Israel: 'God will raise [up] for you out of your brothers a prophet like me.' 38 He is [the one] that was among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with your fathers, and he received living sayings to give to us.
39 To his commands our fathers refused to listen, but they pushed him away and turned themselves in their heart to Egypt, 40 saying to Aaron: 'Make for us gods that can go before us! For this Moses, who led us out of Egypt – we do not know what has happened to him.'
	41 Therefore they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and they had joy by the work of their hands. 42 But God turned himself and gave them over to serving the host of heaven, as has been written in the book of the prophets: 'Surely you did not give me gifts and sacrifices for [ter = through] forty years in the wilderness, House of Israel? 43 But you carried the tent of Moloch and the star of Rephan your god, the images that you made to worship them. Therefore I will take you away, beyond Babel [= Babylon].'
	44 Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, like [he] who spoke to Moses commanded that one was to make it, according to the image that Moses saw. 45 And our fathers that received it brought it with Joshua into the land being possessed by the peoples that God threw out before our fathers. There it remained until David's days. 46 He found grace before God and requested that he would [Q: will] give Jacob's God a place for dwelling. 47 But Solomon was [the one] that built him a house. 48 And yet the Highest does not dwell in houses made with hands, like the prophet says: 49 'Heaven is my throne, and earth a support for my feet. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is my place for resting? 50 Or was not my hand what made all these things?'
	51 O thrawn ones, uncircumcized in heart and ears, you always stand against the Holy Spirit; like your fathers, so also you! 52 Who among the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they slew [those] who beforehand made known the coming of the Just One, whom you have now given over and you have slain, 53 you who received the Law as given through angels, but you have not kept it.  
	54 When they heard these things they were cut in their heart, and they ground their teeth against him. 55 But he, full of Holy Spirit, looked into heaven and saw God's glory, and Jesus stand by God's right hand. 56 And he said: “Behold, I see heaven opened, and the Son of Man stand by God's right hand.” 57 But they cried with a mighty voice and stopped their ears, and they went rushing together upon him.
58 And after they threw him out of the city they threw stones at him. And the witnesses put away their clothes by a young man whose name was Saul. 59 And they threw stones at Stephen while he was praying and saying: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” 60 Then he fell upon his knees [dual] and cried with a loud voice: “Lord, do not count this sin against them!” And after saying that, he expired.
CHAPTER 8
Saul assented to the murder of him. 
	On that day a great persecution arose against the congregation which was in Jerusalem; all except the apostles were scattered through[out] the regions of Judea and Samaria. 2 But some men who feared God carried Stephen to his grave, and they made a great lamentation for him. 3 But Saul fell upon the congregation in an extremely harsh manner. Going into house after house and dragging outside men and women alike, he threw them into prison.
	4 But those that were scattered went through the land, making known the gospel about the Word. 5 Philip went down into the city of Samaria and made the Christ known to them. 6 With one mind the crowds heeded the things being spoken by Philip while they listened and watched the signs that he did. 7 And there were numerous ones that had unclean spirits [in them], and they went out crying with a mighty voice. Furthermore, many that were lame and impeded were healed. 8 Therefore [there] was much joy in that city.
	9 But [there] was in the city a man called Simon, who beforehand did magic and startled the nation of Samaria, saying about himself that he was a great person. 10 And all among them, from the least to the greatest, gave heed to him and said: “This man is God's power, which is called Great.” 11 Therefore they gave heed to him, since for [ter = through] a long time he had caused them to marvel with his magic. 12 But when they believed the sayings of Philip, who made known God's kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, men and women alike.
13 Also Simon believed, and after being baptized he remained with Philip and was being filled with wonder when he watched the sings and mighy deeds that happened.
	14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had [Q: has] received God's word, they sent Peter and John to them. 15 They [dual] went down and prayed for them [pl.] to receive Holy Spirit. 16 For still it had not fallen upon them, but they were solely baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 Then they [dual] put their hands on them [pl.], and they [pl.] received Holy Spirit.
	18 Now when Simon saw how the spirit was being given by putting hands [on people], he put silver-pieces before them, 19 saying: “Give also to me this power, that anyone on whom I put my hands will receive Holy Spirit.” 20 But Peter said to him: “May your silver and you be destroyed together, since you thought that you were going to possess God's gift for money!”
21 You do not have a part or a portion in this matter, for your heart is not straight before God. 22 Therefore find repentance concerning this wickedness, and ask of the Lord that your heart's thought will be forgiven you, 23 for I see that you are a poisonous gall and a bond of unrighteousness.” 24 In answer Simon said: “You make request of the Lord for me, to stop the things of which you spoke from coming upon me.”
	25 Thus, after they gave a full witness and speaking the Lord's word, they returned to Jerusalem, and they made the gospel known in numerous villages of the Samareans.
	26 But the Lord's angel spoke to Philip, saying: “Rise and go southwards to the road that goes down from Jerusalem into Gaza.” That is in the wilderness.
27 And he arose and went, and behold! there came a minister [arandur, king's servant] from Ethiopia, a mighty man under Candace, queen of the people of Ethiopia. He had gone to Jerusalem to give worship, 28 but he returned and sat in his cart reading Isaiah the prophet. 29 And the Spirit said to Philip: “Go near to the cart and stick to it!” 30 Philip ran beside it and heard him read Isaiah the prophet, and he said: “Do you truly understand what you read?” 31 He said: “How will it be possible for me to understand when I lack anyone who will show me what it means?” And he requested of Philip to come into the cart to sit with him. 33 But the part of the scripture that he read was this: “Like a sheep he was being brought to the slaughter, and like a lamb that is voiceless before [the one] ho cuts off its wool, he did not open his mouth. 33 In his humiliation the judgement was taken away from him. About his generation who will tell? For his life has been taken away from earth.”
	34 In answer the minister said: “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this? About himself or about another person?” 35 Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture he made known to him the gospel about Jesus. 36 Now while they [dual] went on the road, they came to a place where [there] was water, and the minister said: “Look, water! What stops me form being baptized?” 37 Philip answered: “If you believe with all your heart, that can happen.” 38 And he commanded the cart to halt, and both went into the water, Philip and the minister together, and he baptized him. 39 After they [dual] came up form the water, the Lord's spirit quickly led Philip away, and the miniser did not see him [any]more, and he went on his road in joy. 40 But Philip was found in Asoto [Azotus, Ashdod], and he went through the region and made the gospel known to all the cities until he reached Caesarea.
CHAPTER 9
But Paul, still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the chief priest and asked him for letters [lit. asked from him messages] for the synagogues in Damascus, for him to bring bound to Jerusalem anyone that he found was of the Way, men and women alike.
	3 On his journey, when was coming near to Damascus, suddenly [there] shone around him a light from heaven, 4 and after falling to the ground he heard a voice say to him: “Saul, Saul, what is your reason for persecuting me?” 5 He said: “Who are you, Lord?” He said: “I [am] Jesus, whom you persecute! 6 But rise and come into the city, and [that] which is necessary for you to do will be told to you.”
	7 The men that went with him stood dumb, for they heard the voice, but did not see anyone. 8 But Saul arose from the ground, and though his eyes were open he saw nothing. Therefore they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9 And for three days he saw nothing, and he did not eat or drink.
10 [There] was in Damascus a disciple whose name was Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision: “Ananias!” He said: “Here I am, Lord.” 11 The Lord said to him: “Rise, go to the street called Straigth, and in the house of Judas seek a man called Saul, from Tarsus. For look! he is praying, 12 and he has seen in a vision a man called Ananias come in and put his hands on him, for him to see again.” 12 But Ananias answered: “Lord, I have heard from numerous ones about this man, about all the evil things that he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem. 14 And here he has received power from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.” 15 But the Lord said to him: “Go, for this man is for me a chosen tool, to bear my name to the nations and to kings and to [the] sons of Israel alike. 16 For I will show him everything that it is necessary for him to suffer for my name.”
	17 Then Ananias went, and he came into the house, and he put his hands on him and said: “Saul, brother – the Lord, the Jesus that showed himself to you on the road on which you came, has sent me for your to see again and for you to be filled with Holy Spirit.” 18 And in the same moment [there] fell from his eyes [dual] what seemed like shells, and he could again see, and he arose and was baptized. 19 Then he ate and was strengthened.
	For some days he remained with the disciples in Damascus, 20 and without waiting he made Jesus known in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 21 But all that heard him were filled with wonder and said: “Is this man not [the one] who in Jerusalem destroyed all that call on this name, and who came here for the purpose that he was going to lead them bound to the chief priests? 22 But Saul was being strengthened, and he made the Jesus that dwelt in Damascus wholly confused by showing that Jesus is the Christ.
	23 After a sufficient number of days the Jews made a consideration together, about how they were going to destroy him. 24 But their plan against him became known to Paul. But they also watched the gates closely, day and night alike, to destroy him. 25 Therefore his disciples took him and sent him down by rope in a basket through a hole in the wall.
	26 When he came to Jerusalem he tried to join [lit. unite himself to] the disciples, but all feared him, since they did not believe that he was a disciple. 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he told them everything about how in on the road he saw the Lord, and that he spoke to him, and how in Damascus he spoke with boldness in Jesus' name. 28 And he remained with them, going in and out in Jerusalem, speaking with boldness in the Lord's name, 29 talking and quarreling with the Jews that spoke Greek. But they made plans to destroy him. 30 When the brothers perceived that, they brought him to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
	31 Now the congregation in all of Judea and Galilee had peace and was being built up, and while they walked in fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, their number rose.
	32 Now when Peter went through all regions he came down also to the holy ones that dwelt in Lydda. 33 There he found a man called Aeneas, who had lain on his bier for eight years, since he was lame. 34 And Peter said to him: “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and arrange your bed!” And he arose in the same moment. 35 And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
	36 But in Joppa there was a female disiciple whose name was Tabitha, which means Dorcas [= Gazelle]. She was full of good deeds and gifts of mercy that she did. 37 But in those days she became ill and died. They washed her and put her in the upper room. 38 Since Lydda was near to Joppa, when the disciples heard that Peter was in that city they sent two men to him to request of him: “Do not be late in coming to us!” 39 They Peter arose and went with them. And when he came thither, they led him into the upper room, and all the widows stood with him in tears, showing him many tunics and cloaks that Dorcas made while she was still with them. 40 But Peter sent all outside, fell upon his knees and prayed. Then, after turning [Q: turning himself] to the body, he said: “Tabitha, rise!” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. 41 Peter gave her his hand and raised her [up], and he called the holy ones and the widows and put her before them alive.
	42 This matter became known to all in Joppa, and numerous ones believed in the Lord. 43 For a sufficient number of days he remained in Joppa with a man called Simon, a leather-worker.
CHAPTER 10
There was a man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the army division [hosse-ranta] called the Italian, 2 who was reverent and feared God with his entire family, and he gave many gifts of mercy to the people and was praying to God always. 3 Around the ninth hour he saw in a vision an angel of God come inside to him and saying to him: “Cornelius!” 4 The man looked at him, and being frightened he said: “What do you want, Lord?” He said to him: “Your prayers and your gifts of mercy have ascended like a reminder before God. 5 And now, send some men to Joppa and call a person called Simon, who has the nickname Peter. 6 This man dwells in [the] house of a man whose name is Simon, a leather-worker, who has his house by the sea.”
	7 After the angel who spoke to him went away, he called two of the servants of his house and a reverent soldier from among those that remained with him, 8 and he told them everything and sent them to Joppa.
	9 On the following day, when they were on their journey and were coming near to the city, Peter went up to the roof around the sixth hour, in order to pray. 10 But he was hungry and wanted to eat. While they prepared, he went into a vision 11 and saw heaven opened and some kind of vessel that came down like  a huge sheet of linen, 12 and in it [there] were all kinds of four-legged [beasts] and creeping things and birds of heaven. 13 And a voice came to him: “Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!” 14 But Peter said: “By no means, Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean have I ever eaten!”
15 And the voice said to him a second time: “Do not call defiled [the things] that God has cleansed!” 16 This happened a third time, and then the vessel was taken into heaven.
	17 While Peter was still very uncertain about what the vision that he had seen signified, behold! the men sent by Cornelius stood before the gate after asking their way to the house of Simon. 18 While Peter thought about the vision, the spirit said: “Behold! Three men are seeking you. 20 But go down and follow them, and do not be uncertain about anything, for I have sent them.” 21 Thus Peter went down and said to the men: “Behold, I am [the one] that you are seeking. What is your reason for coming here?”
22 They said: “Cornelius the centurion, a man just and reverent, of whom the whole nation of [the] Jews speak well, has received a command through a holy angel about sending for you, for you to come to his house and for him to hear your sayings.” 23 Then he requested of them to come inside, and he received them as guests.
	On the following day he arose and went with them, and some of the brothers in Joppa went with him. 24 One [24-hour] day thereafter he went into Caesarea. Cornelius, waiting for their coming, beforehand called together the people of his family and his close friends. 25 When Peter went inside, Cornelius met him, fell down before his feet and gave him worship. 26 But Peter raised him [up], saying: “Rise; I as well am a man!” 27 And while he was speaking with him, he entered and found numerous people assembled. 
28 And he said to them: “You know well how to a Jew [it] is wholly against the Law to unite himself to a person of another nation, or to go into his house. And yet God showed me that I am not to call anyone defiled or unclean. 29 Therefore I indeed came, without speaking against your calling when I was being summoned. Therefore I ask: What is your reason for sending to me?”
	30 And Cornelius said: “Four days ago, counting from this hour, I prayed in my house when behold! a man with bright garment stood before me 31 and said: “Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God. 32 Therefore send to Joppa and call [for] Simon, who has the nickname Peter. This man is a guest in the house of another Simon, a leather-worker, by the sea.” 32 Therefore in the same hour I sent [people] to you, and you did well by coming here. And so in this hour all among us are here before God, to hear all the things that the Lord has commanded you to say.”
	34 Then Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I perceive that God does not heed faces [= is not partial], 35 but from every nation he receives well the person that fears him and does righteousness. 36 He sent the word to [the] sons of Israel to make known to them the gospel of peace through Jesus Chrsit; he is Lord of all. 37 You know the saying that went through the entire Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism about which John talked – 38 about Jesus from Nazareth, how God annointed him with Holy Spirit and with power, and he went through the land, doing good deeds and healing all upon which the Devil's power lay heavy, for God was with him. 39 And all among us are witnesses of the things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem alike, but they also killed him by hanging him on a tree. 40 Him God raised on the third day and allowed him to show himself, 
41 not to the entire people, but to witnesses chosen by God – to us, that ate and drank with him after his raising from [the] dead. 42 And he commanded us to make known to the people, and to give them witness, that this man was [the one] whom God has placed as judge of living ones and dead ones. 43 About him all the Prophets spoke – that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins by his name.”
	44 While Peter still was still speaking about these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all that heard the word. 45 And the faithful that had come with Peter, those that were of the circumcision, were filled with wonder since the gift of Holy Spirit was poured [out] also upon non-Jews. 46 And they heard them speak in tongues and praise God. Then Peter said: “Can anyone deny them the water, to stop from being baptized these men that have received the same Holy Spirit that we as well have received?” 48 And he commanded them to be baptized by the name of Jesus Christ. Then they requested of him that he would remain with them for [ter, through] some days.
CHAPTER 11
Now the apostles and the brother that were in Judea heard that some non-Jews also received God's word. 2 But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the people of circumcision quarreled with him, 3 saying that he had gone [Q: went] into the house of men that were not circumcized and had eaten [Q: ate] with them. 4 Then Peter began to tell them everything as it had happened, saying:
	“I was in Joppa city when I saw a vision, a kind of vessel that came down like a huge sheet of linen, being sent down from heaven by its four corners, and it came near to me. 6 Looking into it I watched and saw the four-legged creatures of earth and the wild beasts and the creeping things and the birds of heaven. 7 I also heard a voice say to me: Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!
8 But I said: By no means, Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean has ever come into my mouth! 9 A second time the voice from heaven answered: Do not call unclean [the things] that God has cleansed! 10 This happened a third time, and everthing was drawn back into heaven. 11 And behold! in that moment three men stood by the house that we were in, for they were sent from Caesarea to me. 12 Therefore the spirit commanded me to go with them, not being uncertain about anything. But these six brothers also went with me, and we went into the man's house. 13 He told us how he saw the angel stand in his house, saying: Send some men to Joppa and summon Simon who has the nick-name Peter, 14 and he will speak to you sayings by which you will be saved, you and your family. 15 But when I began to speak, the spirit fell upon them just as it fell also upon us in the beginning.
16 Then I recalled the Lord's saying, how he said: John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit. 17 Therefore, if God gave the same gift to them as to ourselves that have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who am I, that I will be able to stop God?”
	18 Now when they heard these things, they said nothing more against him, and they gave glory to God, saying: “Then God has indeed given repentance leading to life also to non-Jews.”
	19 Therefore [those] that were scattered by the tribulation that arose concerning Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, but they spoke the word only to the Jews. 20 But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene that came to Antioch and talked about the gospel of the Lord Jesus also to [those] that spoke Greek. 21 Furthermore, the Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned themselves to the Lord. 
	22 The story about them came to the ears [dual] of the congregation which was in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch. 23 When he came there and saw God's grace, he had joy and urged them sincerely to remain in God's will, 24 for he was a good man and full of Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great crowd was added to the Lord. 25 Then he went away to Tarsus to seek Saul, 26 and after he found him, he led him to Antioch. Thus it came [about] that for a full year they [dual] assembled with them in the congregation and taught a huge crowd, and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians [Hristonduri, Christ-servants].
	27 In those days [there] came prophets down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 One among them, whose name was Agabus, arose and made known by the Spirit that [there] was going to come a great famine upon the entire world. That indeed came in the days of Claudius. 29 Therefore [those] that had more than their need chose to send assistance [mána: a boon] to the brothers that were in Judea. 30 And so they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
CHAPTER 12 
Around that time Herod the King laid hands on some persons of the congregation, to evil to them. 2 He killed Jacob, the brother of Jacob, by sword. 3 Seeing how the Jews thought well about that, he also seized Peter. That happened in the days of unleavened breads. 4 After he seized him, he put him in prison, giving him into the hands of four groups, each having four soldiers, for he intended to show him to the people. 5 Thus Peter was kept in prison, but the entire congregation was intensely [veassenen: with vigour] praying to God for him. 
6 In the night before Herod was going to lead him before the people, Peter was asleep, bound with two chains between to soldiers, and some guards before the door kept the gaol. 7 But behold! the Lord's angel stood by him, and a light shone in the room. Tapping Peter's body he woke him up, saying: “Rise quickly!” And his chains fell from his hands. 8 The angel said to him: “Put your girt around your hips and tie your shoes on your feet!” He did so. And he said to him: “Put your cloak on your body and follow me!” 9 And he went outside and followed him, but he did now know that what happened [Q: happens] by the angel was [Q: is] true. He supposed that he saw  [Q: is seeing] t a vision. 10 Passing by the first guard, and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, and that opened itself to them. And after they [dual] went outside they walked down one street, and in that moment the angel went away from him.
11 And Peter, finding himself, said: “Now I know that the Lord sent his angel and delivered me from Herod's hand and from everything that the people of the Jews is waiting for.»
	12 After making a consideration he went to the house of Mary, mother of John who had the nickname Mark. In the house a quite large [fárea: sufficient] number of people were assembled, praying. 13 When he knocked on [ana: against] the door, a female slave whose name was Rhoda came to open, 14 and when she recognized Peter's voice, for [-nen] her joy she did not open the gate, but ran inside and told that Peter was standing [Q: is standing] before the door. 15 They said to her: “You are out of your mind!” But she said forcefully [veassenen: with vigour] that so it was [Q: is]. They said: “It is his angel.” 16 But Peter remained where he was, knocking. When they opened, they saw him and were startled. 17 But he made a gesture to them with his hand, for them to be silent, and he told them everything about how the Lord led him out of gaol, and he said: “Tell these things to Jacob and to the brothers.” Then he went outside and went to another place.
18 When morning came, there was no little exitement among the soldiers, about what really had happened to Peter. 19 Herod sought him, and when he did not find him, he commanded that one was to lead the soldiers away for punishment. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and remained there.
	20 He had great wrath against the people of [lit. in] Tyre and Sidon. As one they came to him, and they spoke with Blastus, the chief of the bedchamber of the king, and gained his support. Thereafter they asked for peace, for their land received its food from that of the king. 21 But on a set day Herod covered himself with a royal garment and sat down on the seat of judgement and talked to them. 22 Then the people cried: “A god's voice, and not [that] of a man!” 23 In the same moment the Lord's angel struck him, since he did not give the glory to God. He was eaten by worms and expired.
	24 But the Lord's word grew and spread. 25 Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem after they completed their service, and they brought John, who had the nickname Mark. 
CHAPTER 13
[There] were in Antioch some prophets and teachers [*peantar-li > peantalli] in the congregation that was there, Barnabas and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius from Cyrene, and Manaen who was instructed [or, educated] with Herod the farthing-ruler, and Saul. 2 While they were doing service for the Lord and were fasting, the Holy Spirit said: “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I called them.” 3 Then they kept a fast and prayed and put their hands [dual] upon them [dual] and let them [dual] go.
4 Therefore these men, sent by the Holy Spirit, went down into Seleucia, and from there they [dual] sailed away to Cyprus. 5 And when they [dual] came into Salamis they made God's word known in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John with them [dual], helping them [dual].
	6 When they [plural] went through the entire island as far as Paphos, they met a man who was a wizard, a false prophet [furutercáno: lie-herald]. 7 He was with Sergius Paulus, the governor, who was an intelligent man. After he called Barnabas and Saul to himself, this man sought to hear God's word. 8 But Elymas the wizard – for that is what his name means – stood against them [dual], seeking to turn the governor away from the faith. 9 Saul, who is also Paul [Paulus/Paulo], was filled with Holy Spirit, looked at him 10 and said: “O man full of every kind of lie and of every wicked deed, o son of the Devil, o enemy of all that is just, will you not stop twisting the straight roads of the Lord?
11 And now, behold, the Lord's hand is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sunlight for a time.” In the same moment mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went seeking people to lead him by the hand. 12 Then the governor, when he saw what was happend, believed; and he marveled at [-nen] the Lord's teaching.
	13 The men that were with Paul now went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John abandoned them and returned to Jerusalem. 14 But they [dual], after they went away from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the sabbath and sat down. 15 After the reading out of the Law and of the Prophets, the synagogue chiefs sent to them, saying: “Men, brothers, if you have a word of comfort for the people, tell it!”
	16 And Paul arose, and making a gesture with his hand he said: “Men, Israelites and you who fear God, listen! 17 The God of our people Israel chose our fathers and made our people great while they were dwelling as foreigners in Egypt; then with a mighty arm he led them out from there, 18 and through[out] forty years he gave them food in the wilderness. 19 After he destroyed ten peoples in Canaan, he caused them to possess their land 20 for about four hundred and fifty years. Thereafter he gave them judges, until Samuel the Prophet. 21 Then they requested a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin. After forty years 22 he put him away and raised up David son of Jesse to be king, about whom he also said as a witness: I have found David son of Jesse a man according to my heart, who will do my entire will. 23 From this man's seed, God by his promise sent a Savior to Israel, Jesus, 24 after John, before his coming, made baptism of repentance known to the entire people of Israel. 25 But when John was soon going to complete his run, he said: Who do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, after me comes a person whose shoes [dual] I am not worthy to loosen!
	26 Men, brothers, sons of the kin of Abraham and the people among you that fear God: To you the word of this salvation has been sent. 27 For [those] that dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers did not know this person, but when they judged him they made true the sayings of the Prophets, which are being read aloud on every sabbath, 28 and though they did not find [any] cause of death, they requested from Pilate that one was to kill him. 29 After they completed all the things written about him, they took him down from the tree and put him in a grave. 30 But God raised him out of [the] dead, 31 and through[out] many days he was being seen by those that had gone with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, that are now his witnesses to the people.
32 For we [excl.] make known to you the gospel about the promise given to the fathers: 33 that God has made it real to us [incl.], their children, by resurrecting Jesus, as is also written in the second psalm: You are my son, I begat you today. 34 That he resurrected him out of [the] dead, and that he will not return to a corrupt state, he has said [= expressed] thus: I will give to you David's mercies, the faithful ones. 35 Therefore he also says in another psalm: You will not allow your faithful one to see a corrupt state. 36 For David, after he was a servant to God's will in his own generation, died and as put [or, lain] with his fathers and saw a corrupt state. 37 But [he] whom God raised did not see a corrupt state. 38 Therefore you are to know – men, brothers – that through this man the forgiveness of sins is made known to you. 39 For the guilt from which it was not possible for you to be freed by the Law of Moses – concerning that anyone who believes is said [to be] without guilt [or: is pronounced guiltless]. 
40 Therefore see that [that] which is said in the Prophets will not come upon you: 41 Look, you who speak mockery, and be filled with wonder, for I do a work in your days – a work that you will by no means believe even if anyone tells you about it!”
	42 [When] leaving, the people asked to hear more about these matters on the following day of rest. 43 Therefore, after the people that were assembled scattered, numerous ones among the Jews and the converts that feared God followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to remain in God's grace.
	44 On the following day of rest nearly the entire city assembled to hear the word of the Lord. 45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with envy, and with blasphemy they spoke against the things said by Paul.
46 Then, talking with boldness, Paul and Barnabas said: “To you it was necessary to first speak God's word. Since you push it away and do not count yourselves worthy for eternal life, behold! we turn [Q: turn ourselves] to non-Jews. 47 For so the Lord has commanded us: I have put you like a light of nations, for you to be salvation to the remotest part of earth.” 
	48 When the people of the nations heard that, they had joy and praised God's word, and all that were destined for eternal life believed. 49 Furthermore, the Lord's word was carried through the entire country. 50 But the Jews stirred up the reverent women and the prominent men in the city, and they raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them beyond their borders. 51 They [dual] shook the dust from their feet [dual] and went to Iconium. 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and Holy Spirit.
CHAPTER 14
Now in Iconium they [dual] went together into the synagogue, and they spoke in a manner causing a huge multitude to believe, Jews and Greeks alike. 2 But the Jews that did not believe stirred up the non-Jews and made them hostile against the brothers. 3 And yet, for a long time, they [dual = Paul and Barnabas] spoke with boldness by the power of the Lord, who witnessed to the word of his grace, by allowing signs and portents to happen through their [dual] hands.
	4 But the multitude in the city was split, and some people were for the Jews and some others for the apostles. 5 There was an uprising of non-Jews and the Jews alike, with their rulers, to humiliate them [dual] and to kill them with stones. 6 When they [dual] perceived it, they fled to the cities in Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe and the country surrounding it. 7 And there they [dual] made the gospel known.
	8 And in Lystra [there] was a man sitting who could not stand on his feet. He was lame from his mother's womb and had not ever walked. 9 This man listened to Paul when he talked, and when Paul looked at him and saw that he had the faith to be healed, 10 he spoke to him with a mighty voice: “Stand up on your feet, straight!” And he jumped up and walked. 11 And the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, raised their voices, saying in the tongue of Lycaonia: “The gods have become men and have come down to us!” 12 And they called Barnabas Zeus, but Paul Hermes, since he was [the one] who spoke for them [dual]. 13 And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to sacrifice with the crowds.
	14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about that, they rent their cloaks and jumped into the crowd, crying 15 and saying: “Men, what is your reason for doing these things? Also we [dual] are men that suffer the same things that you suffer, and we [dual] make the gospel known to you, wishing that you will turn yourselves away from these empty things to the living God, who created heaven and earth and sea and all the things in them.
16 In the past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways, though he did not let himself lack witness about his doing good, giving them rain from heaven and fruit in the proper time, filling their heart with food and joy.” 18 And speaking so they [dual] stopped – though with difficulty – the crowds from sacrificing to them [dual].
	19 But [there] came some Jews from Antioch and Iconium and spoke to the crowds and changed their mind, and they threw stones at Paul and drew him out of the city, supposing that he was [Q: is] dead. 20 But when the disciples surrounded him, he arose and went into the city. And on the following day he went away with Barnabas, going to Derbe. 21 And after they made known the gospel to that city and made a quite large [lit. 'sufficient'] number of disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch.
22 They strengthened the souls of the disciples, urging them to remain in the faith by saying: “It is necessary for us to go into God's kingdom through many tribulations.” 23 Furthermore, they [dual] appointed for them elders in every congregation, and by praying and fasting they [dual] gave them into [the] hand of the Lord in whom they [pl.] believed.
	24 And they [dual] went through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia, 25 and after they spoke the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 26 And from there they [dual] sailed away to Antioch, where beforehand God's grace was put in their [dual] care for the work they had now completed.
	27 After they [dual] came there and gathered the congregation, they [dual] told them [plural] about all the things that God had done through them [dual], and that he had [Q: has] opened to the non-Jews the door of faith. 28 Then they [dual] remained for not a short time with the disciples. 
CHAPTER 15
And some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers: “If you are not circumcised, by the tradition [haime, habit] of Moses, it is not possible for you to obtain salvation.” 2 But after no small strife and quarreling among them and Paul and Barnabas, they arranged that Paul and Barnabas and some others from them were going to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this dispute.
	3 Therefore they, sent by the congregation, went through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling how some non-Jews were converted [lit. turned themselves], and they brought great joy to the brothers. 4 When they came to Jerusalem they were received by the congregation and the apostles and the elder men, and they told about all the things that God did by them. 5 And yet some persons from the  order of the Pharisees that believed, arose from their seats and said: “It is necessary to circumcize them and command them to keep the law of Moses.”
	6 And the apostles and the elders assembled to make a consideration about this matter. 7 After much dispute Peter arose and said to them: “Men, brothers, you know that from the first days God's choice was that through my mouth the nations were going to hear the word of the gospel, for them to believe. 8 Thus God, who knows the hearts, witnessed to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, as he also did to us. 9 In nothing did he behave towards us and them in a different manner, after cleansing their heart by faith. 10 Therefore, now what is your reason for testing God, by putting on the neck of these disciples a yoke that it was not possible to us and to our fathers alike to bear? 11 On the contrary, we believe that we will be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, as also these people believe.
	12 And the entire multitude was made silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul when they [dual] told about all the signs and portents that God had done among the nations through them [dual]. 13 After they stopped talking, Jacob said: “Men, brothers listen to me! 14 Symeon has told how God first gave heed to the nations to take out of them a people for his name. 15 And the words of the prophets say the same thing, as is written: 16 'After these things I will return and I will rebuild David's fallen shelter, and I will rebuild its ruinous parts and I will raise it agan, 17 causing [those] that remained among the men to seek the Lord, with people from all the nations,' says the Lord who is doing these things, 18 known from of old. 19 Therefore my judgment is that we are not to cause difficulty to the people from the nations that turn themselves to God, 20 but that we will write to them that it is necessary for them to keep themselves away from idols and fornication and from what is strangled, and from blood. 21 For from ancient times Moses has had in all cities people that make him known, since he is read out in the synagogies on every day of rest.”
	22 Then it seemed well to the apostles and the elders and to the whole congregation to send some chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, prominent men among the brothers, 23 and by their hand they wrote:
	“The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to the brothers that are in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, they that are of the nations: Greetings! [lit. sit in happiness/goodness]. 24 Since we have heard that some people from among us have caused you difficulty with their words, trying to overturn your soul though we have not given them instructions, 25 we have with one mind made the choice that we will send some men to you with our dear ones, Barnabas and Paul, 26 men that have put their life in danger, for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 Therefore we send Judas and Silas, to tell you the same things by word. 28 For it seemed well to the Holy Spirit and to us not to put another burden upon you except these things that are necessary: 29 Keep yourselves away from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from strangled animals, and from fornication. If you keep yourselves away from these things, you will do well. Health to you!”
	30 Thus, when these men were being sent, they went down to Antioch, and they gathered the multitude and gave them the letter. 31 And after they read it, they had joy by the encouragement [hortale: urging]. 32 And Judas and Silas, since also they [dual] were prophets, urged the brothers with many words and strengthened them. 33 After dwelling there for [lit. though] a time, they were released by the brothers back to [those] that sent them. 34 But Silas thought it was good for him to tarry there. 35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they [dual] and numerous others made known the gospel about the Lord's word.
	36 After some days Paul said to Barnabas: “Let us [dual] return and see to the brothers in every city in which we [dual] made known God's word, to see how they are doing.” 27 But Barnabas wished to bring with himself also John, who was called Mark. 38 But Paul did not think it was good to bring the men who abandoned them [dual] in Pamphylia and did not go with them [dual] to the work. 39 The anger between them was so sharp that it caused them to abandon one another, and Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus. 40 Paul chose Silas [as a companion] and went away after the Lord's grace was put in his keeping by the brothers. 41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.
CHAPTER 16
Then he came to Derbe and also to Lystra. And behold! [there] was there a disciple whose name was Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman, but of a Greek father. 2 Of him all the brotehrs in Lystra and Iconium spoke well. 3 Paul wished that he would come with him, and he took and circumsized him, by reason of the Jews that were in those regions, for all knew that his father was Greek. 4 But when they [dual] went through the cities, they commanded them to keep the statutes fixed by the apostles and elders that were in Jerusalem. 5 Thus the congregations were being strengthened in the faith and rose in number from day to day.
	6 Furthermore, they [dual] went through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, since the Holy Spirit forbade to speak the word in Asia, 7 but when they [dual] came to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia, but Jesus' spirit did not allow them [dual].
8 After they [dual] went through Mysia they came down to Troas. 9 And in the night Paul received a vision: A man from Macedonia stood requesting of him, saying: “Come over into Macedonia and help us!” 10 After he saw the vision, we sought to go to Macedonia, supposing that God summoned us to make the gospel known to them.
	11 Therefore we sailed from Troas and went straight to Samothrace, but on the following day to Neapolis 12 and from there to Philippi, a colony [vinyamar: new home], which is the most prominent city in the Macedonia region. We halted in this city, remaining for some days. 13 And on the day of rest we went outside though the gate, to a place beside a river which we thought was a place of prayer, and we sat down and talked to the women that were assembled. 14 And a woman whose name was Lydia, a trader in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira who worshipped God, listened, and the Lord opened her heart to give heed to the things that Paul spoke. 13 After she and his family were baptized, she said in entreaty: “If you judge me faithful to the Lord, come into my house and remain!” And she compelled us to come.
	16 And it came [to pass], when we were going to the place of prayer, that a female slave met us, having a spirit of foresight [/prophecy]. She brought her masters much money by using foresight. 17 This woman followed Paul and us, crying these words: “These men are slaves of God Most High, and they make known to you the path of salvation.” 18 She did so for many days. Weary, Paul finally turned [Q: turned himself] and said to the spirit: “I command you by the name of Jesus Christ: Come out of her!” And it came out in the same hour.
	19 When her masters saw that their hope of gain was [Q: is] gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them [dual] to the place of commerce, to the rulers. 20 They brought them to the judges and said: “These men trouble our city, being Jewish, 21 and they [dual] make known customs that are not allowed for us as Romans to receive or follow.” 22 And the crowed arose against them [dual], and the judges, after the tore their cloaks from them [dual], commanded that one was to [Q: will] beat them with sticks [or, with clubs: rundainen]. 23 After they gave them [dual] many blows, they threw them into gaol, commanding the goalkeeper [mando-cundo] to keep them securely. 24 After they received such command, he threw them into the inmost gaol and fastened the their feet [dual] to the block [pano: beam]. 
	25 But around the midst of the night Paul and Silas were praying, praising God with song, and the people in the gaol listened to them. 26 Suddenly a great earthquake happened, causing the foundations of the gaol to shake. Furthermore, in the same moment all the doors were opened, and the chains of all were loosened.
27 The gaoler, when he was awakened and saw the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword and was going to kill himself, supposing that everyone in the gaol was [Q: is] gone. 28 But Paul cried with a mighty voice: “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!” 29 And he asked for lights and jumped inside, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas. 30 And he led them [dual] outside and said: “Lords, what is necessary for me to do to obtain salvation?” 31 They [dual] said: “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your family.” 32 And they [dual] spoke the Lord's word to him and to all that were in his house. 33 And he brought them with him in that hour and washed their stripes, and he and all that were with him were baptized without waiting. 34 And he brought them into his house and put food on the table before them [dual], and he had great joy with his entire familty, since he had found faith in God.
	35 When day came, the judges sent the club-bearers [or, constables] to say: “Release those men!” 36 And the gaoler told these words to Paul: “The judges have sent some men to release you [dual]! Therefore, now come out and go away in peace!” 37 But Paul said to them: “They flogged us [dual] before the people without judgement, men that are Romans, and they threw us [dual] into gaol – and now they are throwing us out secretly? By no means! Let them come and lead us [dual] outside!” 38 The club-bearers told these words to the judges. They [plural] were scared when they heard that they [dual] were [Q: are] Romans. 39 Therefore they [plural] came and made a petition to them [dual], and after they brought them outside, they [plural] asked that they [dual] would go away from the city. 40 But they [dual] came out from the prison and went to the house of Lydia, and when they [dual] saw the brothers they [dual] urged [/encouraged] them. Then they [dual] went away. 
CHAPTER 17
Now they [dual] went through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where [there] was a Jewish synagogue. 2 Thus, by his habit, Paul went in to them, and on three sabbaths he spoke with them about the Scriptures,3 giving them understanding and showing that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise from [the] dead, and he said: “This is the Christ, this Jesus that I make known to you.” 4 Therefore some people among them believed and stuck to Paul and Silas, with a great multitude of the Greeks that served God, and not a few of the most prominent women.
	5 But the Jews were being filled with envy, and after they gathered some wicked men from the place of commerce and formed a crowd, they caused an uprising in the city. They fell upon the house of Jason and sought to bring them ouside to the people.
6 When they did not find them they drew Jason and some brothers to the rulers of the city, crying: “These people that have turned the world upside down have now come here as well, 7 and Jason has received them into his house! And all these people stand against the commands of the Emperor, for they say that [there] is another king, Jesus.” 8 They stirred up the crowd and the rulers of the city  that heard these things, 9 and after taking sufficient security from Jason and the others they released them.
	10 Without waiting, in that night the brothers sent both Paul and Silas to Beroea, and when they [dual] came there, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. 11 They [pl.] were nobler than those that lived in Thessalonica, and they received the word with all good will, and every day they searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so. 12 Therefore numerous ones among them believed, and so did not a few prominent Greek women, also numerous men.
13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica learnt that God's word was [Q: is] being made known also in Beroea by Paul, they came there stirring up and disturbing the crowds. 14 Without waiting the brothers sent Paul away, as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy alike remained were they [dual] were. 15 But [those] that led Paul brought him as far as Athens, and they returned bringing his command to Silas and Timothy: It was necessary for them [dual] to come as soon as they could [lit. to come with their speed].
	16 While Paul was waiting for them [dual] in Athens, his spirit was being disturned by seeing how the city was full of idols. 17 Therefore he talked in the synagoge with the Jews and the others that worshipped God – also in the place of commerce, with those that came there. 18 But some among the philosophers, the Epicureans and the Stoics alike, went into dispute with him, and some people among them said: “What does this idle-talking person want to say?” Others said: “It seems he is making known some foreign gods.” That was since he talked about the gospel about Jesus and the resurrection.
19 Therefore they took him and led him into the Areopagus, saying: “May we know what it is, this teaching that you are speaking? 20 For you bring some ideas that are strange to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.” 21 For all in Athens and all the foreigners there set aside every free moment to do nothing except tell or hear news.
	22 Paul stood up in the middle of the Areopagus and said: “Men from Athens, I perceive that in all things you have an awe for the gods greater than what others have. 23 For while I was going through the city, looking at the things that you worship, I found also an alter on which it was written: “To an unknown god.” Therefore, [that] which you worship without knowing it, that I am making known to you.
24 The God who made the earth and everything that is in it does not dwell in temples made by hands. 25 Furthermore, he is not being served by men's hands, as if he has [any] need of a single thing, he himself giving to all life and breath and all things. 26 And he made out of one man every nation of men, for them to dwell on the entire surface of [the] earth, and he appointed the times and the borders for the dwelling [vehte, 'haunt'] of men, 27 for them to seek God, if they can reach towards him and find him, though indeed he is not far from a single person among us. 28 For by him we have life and we move and we exist, as also some poets [maitar-li > maitalli] among you have said: 'For we are also his kin.'
	29 Therefore, seeing that we are God's kin, we do not do well if we think about the Deity that he is like gold or silver or stone, or an artifact formed by man's art or thought. 30 True, God showed patience in these times when people have been lacking knowledge, but now he says to men in every place that it is necessary for them to find repentance. 31 For he has set a day in which he will judge earth in righteousness by a man that he has chosen, and he has given to all men security [of this] by raising him out of [the] dead.”
	32 But when they heard about resurrection of [the] dead, some among them spoke mockery, while others said: “We will hear you again about this matter another time.” 33 Thus Paul went out from their midst, 34 but some people stuck to him and believed. Among them were Dionysius who was a judge in the Areopagus, and a woman called Damaris, and some others beside them [dual].
CHAPTER 18
After these things he went away from Athens and came to Corinth. 2 And he found a Jew called Aquila, a man born in Pontus, who a short time ago had come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, since by the command of Claudius all Jews went away from Rome. And he came to them, 3 and since they had the same kind of work, he remained with them and laboured. For their work was to make tents. 4 But he talked in the synagogue every sabbath and caused Jews and Greeks to believe.
	5 When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul completely gave himself to making the Word known, witnessing to the Jews that Jesus was [Q; is] the Christ. 6 But when they stood against him and spoke mockery, he shook the dust from his garments and said to them: “May you blood come upon your own head! I am clean. From now I go to non-Jews.” 7 And he moved from there and went into the house of a person called Titius Justus, who worshipped God. His house was built into the same building where the synagogue was. 8 Crispus the synagogue ruler received the faith in the Lord with his entire family, and after hearing, numerous ones among the people of Corinth believed and were baptized. 9 And in a vision in the night the Lord said to Paul: “Do not fear, but speak and do not be silent, for I am with you and no one will do to you [any] evil, for I have numerous people in this city.” 11 And he remained there for one year and six months, teaching among them God's word.
	12 Now when Gallio was proconsul [nóreturco: nation-chief] of Achaia, the Jews with one mind arose against Paul and led him to the judgement seat, 13 saying: “This man causes men to believe it is necessary for them to worship God in a manner against the Law.” 14 But when Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: “If the matter were about [some] evil or a wicked deed, I had reason to have patience with you. 15 But if the matter is about quarrelings about some words and names and the Law that you have, it is necessary for you to see to it. I do not want to be judge concerning these things.” 16 And he drove them away from the judgement seat. 17 But all among them seized Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him before the judgement seat. But Gallio gave heed to none of these things.
	18 But after remaining there for many days more, Paul said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him went Priscilla and Aquila. He went away after cutting his hair in Cencreai, for he had a pledge. 19 They [pl.] came to Ephesus, and he left them [dual] there, but he went into the synagogue and spoke with the Jews. 20 When they requested from him to stay with them for a longer time, he did not want to, 21 but said farewell and told them: “I will return to you again, if God wishes.” And he sailed away to Ephesus and came down to Caesarea. And he went up and greeted the congregation, and went down to Antioch.
	23 And after he dwelt there for [ter = through] a time he went away and travelled from place to place through the country of Alatia and Phrygia, strengthening the disciples.
	24 Now [there] came to Ephesus a Jew whose name was Apollo, born in Alexandria. He knew [how] to talk well and was mighty in the Scriptures. 25 He was instructed in the Lord's way, and since he was glowing with the spirit, he talked and taught what was true concerning Jesus, be he knew only John's baptism. 26 And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they [dual] took him with them and led him to a deeper understanding of God's way. 27 Furthermore, since he wished to go into Achaia, the brothers wrote to the disciples, urging them to receive him well [lit. urging that they were going to receive him well]. Thus, when he came there, he greatly helped those who believed by the grace. 28 And with vigour he indicated the mistake of the Jews, showing from the scriptures that Jesus was [Q: is] the Christ.  
CHAPTER 19
While Apollos was in Corinth it happened [lit. came] that Paul went through the inlands [lit. inside countries] as far as Ephesus. And he found some disciples 2 and said to them: “Did you receive Holy Spirit when you believed?” They said to him: “Indeed we have not [even] heard that [there] is a Holy Spirit.” 3 And he said: “In what, then, were you baptized?” They answered: “In the baptism of John.” 4 Paul said: “John baptized with the baptism of mind-change, urging the people to believe in [the one] who was going to come after him – that is, in Jesus.” 5 When they heard that, they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. 6 And when Paul put his hands [dual] on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and talked like prophets. 7 Their whole number was around twelve men.
	8 He entered the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, talking and bringing others to an understanding of God's kingdom. 9 But when some people made themselves hard and did not believe, speaking mockery about the Way before the multitude, he abandoned them and separated the disciples from them, on every day giving talks in the hall of Tyranus.10 That happened throughout two years, and thus all that dwelt in Asia heard God's word, Jews and Greeks alike.
	11 God did some mighty deeds, beyond what was usual, by Paul's hands. 12 Thus even clothes and aprons were carried from his skin and put on the sick ones, and the illnesses went away from them, and the wicked spirits came out. 13 But [there] were also some wandering Jews among those that threw out demons who tried to speak Jesus' name against [those] who were possessed by demons: “I command you by the Jesus whom Paul makes known.” 14 [There] were seven sons of a man called Sceva, a Jewish high priest, that did so. 15 But in answer the wicked spirit said to them: “Jesus I know, and I have heard about Paul, but who are you?” 16 And the man possessed by the wicked spirit fell upon them and conquered them all, causing them to run wounded and naked out of that house.
17 This matter came to the knowledge of all, of Jews and of Greeks alike, those who dwelt in Ephesus. And fear fell upon all among them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being praised. 18 And numerous ones of [those] who believed came and spoke openly about their deeds. 19 Not a few among those that before used magic gathered their books and burned them before the eyes [dual] of all. And they calculated the sum that they paid for them and found that their value was fifty thousand silver-pieces. 20 Thus, with power, the Lord's word grew and was made mighty.
	21 After these things were finisehd, Paul made [it] his goal that after he went through Macedonia and Achaia he was gong to travel to Jerusalem, saying: “After I shall come there it is also necessary for me to see Rome.” 22 He sent to Macedonia two of his servants, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself remained for a time in Asia. 
	 23 Around that time [there] was not a small uprising concerning the Way. 24 For a man called Demetrius, a silversmith, gave no small wealth to the craftsmen by making silver shrines of Artemis. 25 And he gathered them and [those] who worked with such things and said: “Men, you know well that by this our work we have our wealth. 26 And you see and you hear how not only in Ephesus, but in nearly all Asia, this Paul has brought a big crowd to a new belief, by saying that those gods that are made by hands are not gods at all. 27 Furthermore, [there] is a danger that not only this our work will be despised, but also that the temple of the great Artemis will be counted as nothing, putting an end also to her greatness, before which all Asia and [the] world bow.” 28 Hearing this and being filled with anger, the men cried: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
	29 Thus the city was being filled with confusion, and with one mind they went rushing into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus and bringing them [dual] with them [plural] by force. They [dual] were people from Macedonia traveling with Paul. 30 Paul himself wanted to go inside to the people, but the disciples were not willling to let him. 31 Some among the rulers of Asia, that were his friends, sent to him and asked of him not to put himself in danger in the theater. 32 Some cried one thing and others another thing, and the greater number [i amarimbar, the most numerous ones] did not know the reason by which they were assembled. 33 Therefore they together brought forward Alexander out of the crowd, for the Jews pushed him forward. 34 But when they understood that he was a Jew, they cried with one voice for [ter, through] around two hours: “Great is Artemis of [the] Ephesians!”
	35 After the city scribe made the crowd quiet, he said: “Men, who is [there] among men who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image that fell from heaven? 36 Therefore, since one cannot deny that, you will do well if you are still and do nothing without thought. 37 For you have brought these men that are not robbers of temples and have not spoken mockery against our goddess. 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a dispute with anyone, [there] are court days [lit. days of judgement] and [there] are proconsuls [nóreturcor, land-chiefs]: Let them bring the disputes that they have, one with the other, to the judges. 39 But if you seek more beyond that, it is necessary that a regular assembly settles [tulca, establishes] it. 40 For [there] is danger that complaints about uprising will be brought against us after what has happened today, for we do not have a single reason to give concerning this clamour.” 41 And after he said that, he sent the ones having assembled away.
CHAPTER 20
When the uprising was over, Paul summoned the disciples, and after he encouraged them and said farewell to them, he went away to go into Macedonia. 2 After he went through those regions and encouraged [those] that were there with numerous words, he came into Greece. 3 And after he remained three months there, he was going to said away to Syrian, but since the Jews made plans against him, he made the choice that he was going to return through Macedonia. 4 With him on the journey were Sosipather the son of Pyrrhus from Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, and Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy and Tryphimus from Asia. 5 They went before us and waited for us in Troas, but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Breads, and we came to them in Troas before five days were gone. There we remained for seven days.
	7 On the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread, Paul talked to them, since he was going away on the following day, and he was speaking until the middle of the night. 8 But [there] were many lamps in the upper hall where we were assembled. 9 Sitting by the window was a young man called Eutychus, who fell into deep sleep while Paul was talking, and collapsing in sleep he fell down from the third floor and was dead when he was lifted up. 10 But Paul went down, threw himself upon him, put his arms around him and said: “Do not make clamour, for he is still alive.” 11 Then he returned up, broke the bread and ate, and he talped until dawn and then went away. 12 But the boy they brough away alive, and they were comforted beyond measure.
	13 Now we went before them to the boat and sailed away to Assos, where we were going to receive Paul into the ship. For after he gave commands about that, he himself wished to go on his feet [= by foot]. 14 When he came as far as the place where we were in Assos, we received him into the boat and went to Mitylene. 15 And after we sailed from there on the following day we came beside Chios, and after one more day we reached as far as Samos, and on the following day we came into Miletus. 16 For Paul made the choice that he would pass over Ephesus, not wishing to halt in Asia, for he was traveling in urgency: If he could he wanted to reach Jerusalem before the Festival of Seven Weeks [= Pentecost].
	17 But from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the congregation. 18 When they came to him he said to them: “You know well how from the first day that I came to Asia I was with you the whole time, 19 working for the Lord in all lowliness, having tears and suffering the tribulations that happened to me by the evil plans of the Jews, 20 while I did not keep from you a single thing beneficial to you, or failed to instruct you before the people and in the houses.
21 But I witnessed to Jews and to Greeks alike about repentance towards God and faith in our Lord, Jesus. 22 And now, behold, bound in the spirit I go to Jerusalem, though I do not know [the things] that will happen to me in it, 23 except that in every city the Holy Spirit witnesses to me that bonds and tribulations are waiting for me. 24 And yet I do not count my life that dear to me, if it is possible for me to complete my ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus: Witnessing about the gospel of the grace of God.
	25 And now, behold, I know that you will not see my face again, you all among whom I walked, making known the kingdom  26 Therefore I witness to all among you that I am clean from the blood of all men, 27 for I have not kept myself from telling you God's entire plan. 
	28 Watch yourselves and the entire flock which the Holy Spirit has put in your patronage [/care, protection, overseership]. Be shepherds for the Lord's congregation, which he gained with his own blood. 29 I know that after I pass, oppressive wolves will come among you, that do not have mercy on the flock, 30 and from yourselves [there] will arise some men that speak twisted things, to draw away the disicples after themselves. 31 Therefore be awake, recalling how through[out] three years, at night and at day, I did not stop instructing you with tears. 32 And now I give you over to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you your part as heirs, with all the sanctified ones. 33 Silver or gold or garment I have not sought from anyone. 34 You yourselves know that these hands have given me and [those] who were with me our needs. 35 I always showed you that when you so work it is necessary for you to help [those] that are weak and to recall the word with the Lord Jesus himself spoke: Giving is a joy greater than receiving.
26 And after he spoke these words, he fell upon his knees [dual] with all among them and prayed. 27 [There] was quite a lot of [lit. sufficient] wailing among them all, and they fell upon Paul's neck and kissed him. 28 For above everything they were being tormented by the word that he said, that they were not going to see his face again. Then they followed him to the boat.
CHAPTER 21
After we compelled ourselves to leave them and sailed away, we went straight to Cos, but on the following day to Rhodos, and from there to Patara. 2 And after he found a boat that was to go to Phoenicia, we went aboard [lit. into it] and sailed away. 3 After we saw Cyprus, we went past it on the left, sailed to Syria and came to Tyre, for that was the destination [enne: goal] of the goods on the boat. 
4 We sought the disciples and found them, and we remained there for [ter 'through'] seven days. But by the Spirit they said to Paul: “Do not set foot in Jerusalem!” 5 But when the days were past, we went forth and went on our way. All among them, with the women and children, followed us as far as the outside of the city. And after falling to our knees on the beach we prayed, 6 and we said farewell to one another, and we went into the boat, but they returned home.
	7 From Tyre we came to Ptolemais, completing the voyage [luntelenda: boat-journey]. We greeted the brothers and remained one day with them. 8 On the following day we sailed away and came to Caesarea, and we went into the house of Philip, a man who was making known the gospel. He was among the Seven, and we remained with him. 9 [There] were with this man four daughters, virgins, who had a prophet's gift. 
10 But while we remained there for [ter 'through'] a number of days, a prophet whose name was Agabus came down from Judea, and he came to us and took the belt of Paul. He bound his own feet and hands and said: “Thus says the Holy Spirit: The man who owns this belt the Jews in Jerusalem will bind, and they will give him over to non-Jews.” 12 When we heard this, we and [those] who dwelt there alike asked of him: “Do not go up to Jerusalem!” 13 Then Paul answered: “What are you doing, wailing and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not just to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” 14 When it was not possible for us to change his mind, we stopped asking and said: “Let the Lord's will happen.”
	15 After these days we prepared and went on our journey to Jerusalem. 16 But some of the discipes from Jerusalem also went with us, to bring us to the man in whose house we were going to dwell: Mnason, who was of the first disciples.
	17 When we came to Jerusalem, the brothers received us in [or, with] joy. 18 But on the following day Paul went with us into the house of James, and all the elders were there. 19 And they greeted them and told about every single thing that God did among the nations by his ministry.
	20 After hearing that they gave glory to God, and they said to him: “You behold, brother, how [there] are multitudes that believe among the Jews, and all among them burn for the Law. 21 But they have heard that it has been said concerning you that you have taught among the nations that it is necessary for them to stand away from Moses, teaching them that they are not to circumcise their children or follow the customs. 22 What, then, are we to do? It is certain that they will hear that you have come.
23 Therefore do this thing that we tell you: [There] are with us four men that have a vow. 24 Bring them with you and purify yourself with them, and you pay for them, for them to cut the hair off their head. Then all will understand that what they have heard about you is not true, but that you follow the Law and keep it. 25 Concerning the non-Jews that believe we have written to them, commanding that it is necessary for them to keep themselves away from what has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from flesh of strangled animals and from fornication.”
	26 Then Paul brought the men with him, and on the following day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, to make known the date when their purification was going to be completed and the sacrifice was going to be brought for each one among them.
	27 But shortly before the seven days were complete, the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple and caused an uprising among the crowd, and they put their hands on him 28 and cried: “Men of Israel, help! This man is [the one] who teaches everyone in every place against the people and the Law, and against this [holy] place! Furthermore, he has brought some Greeks into the temple, defiling this holy place!” 29 For before they saw Tryphimus from Ephesus in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul brought him into the temple. 30 And the whole city was stirred, and the people ran together, and they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. In the same moment the gates were closed. 31 And while they sought to kill him, word came to the chief of the army, about all of Jerusalem being in disorder. 32 Without waiting he brought some soldiers [ohtar-li > ohtalli] and centurions [tuxantur-li > tuxantulli] and ran down to them. Seeing the chief and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul. 
33 Then the army commander came and took him and commanded: “Bind him with two chains!” And he asked about who he was and about what he had done. 34 But some in the crowd cried one thing and others another thing. By reason of the noise he could learn nothing certain, and he commanded that they were to bring Paul to the [army] camp. 35 But when he came to the steps [= the stairs] it was necessary for the soldiers to carry him, because of the violence of the crowd. 36 For the multitude of the people followed him, crying: “Kill him!”
	37 When they were going to lead him into the camp, Paul said to the army commander: “May I say something to you?” He said: “Can you speak Greek? 38 Are you really not the Egyptian who before these days caused an unrising and led the four thousand dagger men into the wilderness?” 39 Then Paul said: “I [am] a Jewish man, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, a city not obscure. But I ask of you: Allow me to speak to the people!”
40 After he allowed that, Paul, standing on the steps, moved with his hand to the people. When a deep silence fell, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:
CHAPTER 22
“Men, brothers and fathers, hear me speak for myself!” 2 When they heard that he was speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they were still more silent, and he said: 3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but instructed [or, educated] in this city before the feet of Gamaliel in the tough manner of the Law of our fathers. I was burning for God like all among you [are] on this day. 4 And I went pursuing this Way to the death, binding and giving over into prison men and women alike, 5 as also the chief priest and the entire council of elders can witness for me. From them I also got messages to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring also [those] that were there bound to Jerusalem for punishment.
	6 But on my journey, when I came near to Damascus, around the middle of the day, suddenly out of heaven a great line shone at me, 7 and I fell to earth and heard a voice say to me: 'Saul, Saul, what is your reason for persecuting me?' 8 I answered: 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me: 'I am Jesus from Nazareth, whom you pursue.' 9 The men that were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of [the one] who was speaking to me. 10 Then I said: 'What am I to do, Lord?' The Lord said to me: 'Rise, go into Damascus, and there everything which is appointed to you to do will be told you.' 11 But I could not see, because of the glory of that light, and being led by the hand by [those] that were with me I came into Damascus.
12 But a man called Ananias, who was reverent according to [or 'by', -nen] the Law and had a good witness from all the Jews that dwelt there, 13 came to me, and standing by me he said to me: “Saul, brother, see again!” And in the same hour I could again see, seeing him. 14 He said: 'The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Just One and to hear the voice of his mouth, 15 for you will be a witness to him to all men, about the things that you have seen and have heard. 16 And now, how is it that you are waiting? Rise, be baptized and wash your sins away by calling on [or 'by', -nen] his name.
	17 But after I returned to Jerusalem and prayed in the temple, I received a vision 18 and saw him say to me: 'Be quick and go away from Jerusalem with urgency, for they will not receive your witness about me.' 19 And I said: 'Lord, they know well that I threw into gaol and flogged in every synagogue [those] that believe in you, 20 and while the blood of Stephen your witness was being poured forth, I as well was standing near and thought well about what happened, and I was watching the cloaks of the people that killed him.' 21 And yet he said to me: 'Go, for I will send you to far-off nations!'
27 Therefore the army commander came to him and asked: “Tell me, are you Roman?” He said: “I am.” 28 The army commander answered: “I traded to myself those rights [lertier, freedoms] with a great sum [of money].” Paul said: “But I was born into them.”
	29 Therefore, in the same moment, the men that were going to examine him by torture stood away from him, and fear seized the army commander when he found that he was Roman, after he had bound him.
	30 On the following day he wished to know certainly what evil the Jews said that he had [Q: has] done. Therefore he released him from the chains and commanded the High Council that they were to assemble. Then he brought Paul and put him before them.
23 Paul, looking at the High Council, said: “Men, brothers, I have behaved before God with perfect conscience, until this day.”
	2 Then Ananias the chief priest commanded [those] that stood by him that they were to strike him on the mouth. 3 Then Paul said to him: “God will strike you, O whitened wall! Are you sitting to judge me by the Law, and at the same time you are breaking the Law by commanding that I shall be beaten?” 4 [Those] that stood by him said: “Are you speaking evil about the chief priest of God?” 5 And Paul said: “Brothers, I did not know that he is the chief priest. For [it] is written: Do not speak evil of a chief of your people.”
	6 He knew that among [those] that were there, one part was of [the] Sadducees and another of [the] Pharisees, and therefore he cried in the High Council: “Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and the resurrection of [the] dead I am being judged!” 7 Since he said this thing, there was a dispute between Pharisees and Sadducees, and the multitude was split. 8 For Sadducces say that [there] is not [any] resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees openly believe all these things.
	9 Then there was great clamour, and some scribes that were of the party [ranta, 'part'] of the Pharisees arose and said in dispute: “We do not find [any] evil in this man. What if a spirit has indeed spoken to him, or an angel?” 10 When a sharp strife arose, the army commander feared [Q: feared from] that they were going to pull him into pieces, and he commanded the soldiers that they were to go down to snatch him out of their midst and to bring him into the camp.
	11 But on the following day the Lord stood by him and said: “Courage! For as you have witnessed about [the things] that concern me in Jerusalem, so it is necessary for you to witness also in Rome.” 12 When day came, the Jews made a compact and cursed themselves if they ate or drank before killing Paul. 13 The number of the men who together gave this oath was over forty. 14 They went to the chief priests and to the elders and said: “We have given an oath that we are not going to eat before we have killed Paul. 15 Therefore tell the army chief, you together with the High Council, that it is necessary for him to bring him down to you, as if you wish to make an inquiry to know more certainly the things that concern him. But before he shall come near, we shall be ready to kill him.”
	16 But when Paul's sister's son heard that they were lying hidden to kill him, he went to him, and when he came to the camp he told it to him. 17 Therefore Paul called one among the centurions and said: 'Bring this young man to the army chief, for he has a thing to tell him.” 18 Therefore this man took him and brought him to the army chief, and he said: “Paul, the bound man, called me and asked of me that I would bring this young man to you, for he has a thing to say to you.” 19 The army chief took his hand and went away to a private place and asked: “What do you have to tell me?”
	20 He said: “The Jews together have made a plan that they will ask that tomorrow you will bring Paul down to the High Council, as if they want to learn more certainly what he has done. 21 But you do not [imperative] allow them to induce you into doing that, for more than forty men among them are lying hidden waiting for him, and they have bound themselves with an oath that they will not eat or drink before they have killed him, and now they are ready, waiting for your assent.” 22 Then the army chief went away from the young man after commanding him: “Do not say to anyone that you have revealed these things to me.”
	23 And he called two of the centurions and said: “Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred men that carry spears, at the third hour of the night. 24 Furthermore, bring some horses. Thus, letting Paul ride, they will bring him in safety to Felix the governor.” 
25 And he wrote a message having these words: 26 “Claudius Lysias to the mighty governor, Felix: Greetings! [lit. sit in happiness!] 27 This man was seized by the Jews and was near to being slain by them, but I fell upon them with the soldiers and saved him, since I learnt that he was [Q: is]
 a Roman. 28 And wishing to know the reason of their complaint against him, I brought him down into their High Council. 29 I found that complaints about disputes touching on their Law are brought against him, but about nothing worthy of death or of chains. 30 But since a plan against this man has been revealed to me, I sent him to you without waiting, and I command [those] that have complaints about him that they must speak against him before you.”
	31 Therefore these soldiers took Paul, as was commanded to them, and brought him at night to Antipatris. 32 On the following day they let the horsemen go with him still, and returned to the camp.
33 The horsemen went into Caesarea and gave the message to the governor, and put also Paul before him. 34 After he read the letter he asked about what region he came from, and learnt that he was from Cilicia. 35 He said: “I will hear you, when the people that have complaints about you shall arive also.” And he commanded that one was to keep him in gaol in the palace [túrion] of Herod. 
CHAPTER 24
After five days Ananias the chief priest came down with some elders and an orator whose name was Tertulllus, and they spoke evil about Paul. 2 When he was called, Tertullus began to speak against him, saying: 
	“Great peace we have through you, and reforms [or 'renewals'] occur in this nation by your foresight! 3 In all times and places, mighty Felix, we receive those with greatest thanks. 4 But so as not to take more of your time, I ask of you that you will listen to us briefly, gracious as you are. 5 For we have found that this man is a pestilence, causing uprisings among all the Jews through[out] the entire world, and he is prominent in the sect [heren, 'order'] of the Nazarenes, 6 a person who also tried to defile the temple, and whom we seized. We wanted to judge him by our Law, 7 but Lysias the army chief came and took him out of our hands [dual] by violence and brought him away. 8 From him it is possible for you, by examining him, to learn about all the crimes that we say he has done.”
	9 The Jews were his supporters and said that so it was. 10 And Paul, when the governor with a gesture of his head allowed him to talk, answered:
	“Knowing well that this nation has had you as judge for [ter = through] many years, I am speaking freely for myself. 11 It is possible for you to learn that only twelve days ago I went up to give worship in Jerusalem. 12 They did not find me in the temple having a dispute with anyone or causing an uprising, in the synagogues or in the city.
13 Furthermore, it is not possible for them to demonstrate that I have done [/committed] the crimes of which they now speak against me. 14 But this thing I openly tell you: By the Way that they call a 'sect', by it I serve God, believing all the matters that are of the Law and written in the Prophets. 15 And I have hope to God, the same hope that also these men have: [There] will be a resurrection of just ones and injust ones alike. 16 Therefore my goal is that I will always have a clean conscience towards God and men. 17 After some years passed, I came to bring gifts of mercy to my nation, and to sacrifice. 18 While I was doing these things, they found me cleansed in the temple, but [there] was not [any] crowd or uprising. But [there] were there some Jews from Asia, 19 and [it] was better if they came before you to speak about my crimes, if they have a complaint against me. 20 Or let these men say what evil they found in me when I stood before the High Council, 21 if it was not this single saying that I cried when I stood before them: 'Concerning the resurrection of [the]dead I am being judged before you today!'
	29 But Felix, knowing well the matters that concerned the Way, turned the men away and said: “When Lysias the army chief shall come down, I will make my choices about the matters that concern you.” 23 And he commanded the centurion to keep the man in a gentle manner, and he was not going to stop anyone among his own from serving him.
	24 After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was Jewish, and he brought Paul and listened to him about the faith in Christ Jesus. 25 But when he talked about justice and self-control and the coming judgement, Felix was scared and answered: “For this time go away, but when I have an opportunity, I will summon you again.” 26 But at the same time he had the hope that he would receive money from Paul. Therefore he summoned him that more frequently, and he talked with him.
	27 But after two years passed, Felix was followed as governor by Porcius Festus, and since Felix wanted to have the grace of the Jews, he left Paul bound.
CHAPTER 25 
Therefore Festus, when he received the power over the region [/province], after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea, 2 and the chief priests and the prominent ones of the Jews told him their complaints against Paul. Then they asked Festus, 2 seeking a favor [lis: grace] against Paul, that he would [Q: will] send him to Jerusalem. For they were going to lie hidden, to kill him on the road. 4 But Festus answered that Paul was going to remain kept in Caesarea, and that he himself would [Q; will] return there soon. 5 He said: “Therefore may the mighty among you come down to speak of his crimes, if there is anything irregular about him.”
	6 Thus, after remaining with them for [ter, through] no more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and the following day he sat down on the judgement seat and commanded that one was to [Q: will] bring Paul. 7 When he came, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, saying that he had [Q: has] done numerous and weighty crimes, but it was not possible for them to show that that was true.
	8 But Paul said, defending himself: “Against the Law or against the Jews or against the High King alike I have not done [/committed] a single sin.” 9 Festus, who wanted to receive the good will of the Jews, answered Paul: “Do you want to go up to Jerusalem to be judged there before me concerning these matters?” 10 But Paul said: “I am standing before the judgement seat of the High King, where it is necessary for me to be judged. I have done nothing evil against the Jews, as also you well know. 11 If I have indeed done a crime and I am worthy of death, I do not ask to escape from death, but if I have not done a single one of the crimes which they say I have done, nobody may give me into their hand. I put my case [natto, matter] before the High King.”
12 After speaking with the council, Festus answered: “Before the High King you have put your case; to the High King you will go.”
	13 After some days passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus. 14 After they were there for [ter, through] a number of days, Festus told the king about the matters that concerned Paul, saying:
	“[There] is a man left bound by Felix, 15 and when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews told me about him, requesting that I would [Q: will] judge him as having guilt. 16 But I answered them that among Romans it is not custom to give anyone over, before the person of whom others say that he had committed crimes meets those that speak against him face to face, and he has the opportunity to speak for himself concerning the complaint.
17 Therefore, when they assembled here, without halting I sat down on the judgement seat and commanded that one was to [Q: one will] bring the man. 18 Standing before me, those who say that he has committed crimes did not talk about the wicked things that I supposed concerning him. 19 They had some quarrels with him about their own worship of the deity, and about a person called Jesus, who is dead, but who Paul said is alive. 20 Not knowing what I was going to do about the quarrel about these things, I asked if he wanted to go to Jerusalem, there to be judged concerning these matters. 21 But when Paul asked to be kept for the judgment of His Majesty, I commanded that he is to be kept until I shall send him to the High King.”
	22 Then Agrippa said to Festus: “I as well wish to hear the man.” He answered: “Tomorrow you will hear him.” 
	23 Therefore, on the following day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great glory and went into the audience chamber [şambe veliéva = room of meeting] with army chiefs and some prominent men from the city, and when Festus commanded, Paul was brought. 24 And Festus said: “King Agrippa and you that are with us, you behold this man concerning whom the entire multitude of Jews together have made pention to me, in Jerusalemn and here alike, crying that he is not worthy of living anymore. 25 But I perceived that he has done nothing worthy of death. Therefore, when this man put his case before his Majesty, I judged that I would [Q: will] send him. 26 But concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Therefore I brought him out before you, and above all before you, King Agrippa: After the interrogation I will know what I am to write. 27 For it seems to me senseless to send a bound person but fail to indicate the complaints against him.
CHAPTER 26 
Agrippa said to Paul: “You may speak.” Then Paul reached out with his hand and spoke, defending himself:
	2 “Concerning all the crimes that the Jews say that I have done, King Agrippa, I count myself happy that [it is] before you I speak for myself today, 3 above all for the reason that you know all the customs and strifes of among Jews. Therefore I ask that you will hear me with patience.
	4 My manner of living from my youth – how I behaved from the beginning in my nation and in Jerusalem – is known by all Jews 5 that have known me beforehand, if they want to witness. They know that my life as a Pharisee was by the harshest order of our worship. 6 And yet now, by reason of the promise given to our fathers, I am standing here to be judged. 7 Our twelve tribes have the hope that they will see the promise made true if they serve him with vigour through night and day. Concerning this hope the Jews say that I have committed crimes, o King.
	8 What is your reason for judging that one cannot believe that God rises [the] dead? 9 I indeed thought that it was necessary for me to stand against the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth in numerous manners, 10 as I also did in Jerusalem, and numerous ones among the holy ones I put in goals after I received power from the chief priests, and when one spoke about killing them, I gave my vote [lit. voice] againat them. 11 Furthermore, I frequently punished them in all synagogues and compelled them to blaspheme, and being extremely angry against them I also pursued them into foreign cities. 
	12 While I was doing these things – on a journey to Damascus, after receiving power and permission from the chief priests – 13 in the midst of the day, still on the road, I saw a light beyond the glory of the sun which shone around me and around [those] who travelled with me. 14 And after all among us fell to the ground I heard a voice say to me in the Hebrew language: 'Saul, Saul, what is your reason for pursuing me? Striking against the spikes will be painful for you.' 15 But I said: 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said: 'I [am] Jesus, whom you pursue. 16 And yet rise and stand on your feet [dual]. For for this purpose I have shown myself to you, to choose you as a servant and a witness both of [the things] that you have seen and of [the things] that I shall cause you to see, concerning me. 17 I deliver you out of this people and from the nations, to which I send you 18 to open their eyes [dual], in order to turn them from darkness to light and from Satan's power to God, for them to receive forgiveness of sins and a part as heirs among [those] who are hallowed by believing in me.'  
	19 Therfore, king Agrippa, I did not fail to heed the vision from heaven, 20 but firstly to [those] that are in Damascus and then to [those] that are in Jerusalem and the entire land surrounding Judea I brought the message that it is necessary for them to find repentance and turn themselves to God, by doing deeds worthy of repentance.
	21 Concerning these things some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. 22 But since I was being helped by God I have stood witnessing to small and to great, but saying nothing except [the things] that the Prophets and Moses alike said were going to happen: 23 The Christ was going to suffer, and as the first being raised from [the] dead, he was going to make light known to this people and to the nations alike.»
	24 When he said these things defending himself, Festus said in a mighty voice: “You are out of your mind, Paul! Great learning is undoing your mind!” 25 But Paul said: “I am not out of my mind, mighty Festus, but I speak sayings of truth and soundness of mind. 26 For the king understands these things, he to whom I am speaking with boldness, for I am certain that nothing of this escapes his notice, for this thing has not been done in a corner.
27 Do you, King Agrippa, believe in the Prophets? I know that you believe.” 28 But Agrippa said to Paul: “In a short time you would talk me into becoming a Christian.” 29 Then Paul said: “I can wish to God that soon or later, not just you but also all that are hearing me today will become such as I am, though without these chains.” 30 But the king arose, and so did the the governor and Bernice and the men that had sat with them. 31 But when they went away they talked one with the other, saying: “This man does nothing worthy of death or of chains.” 32 Furthermore, Agrippa said to Festus: “It was possible to release this man if he did [/had] not put his case before the High King.”
CHAPTER 27
After the choice [or, decision] was made that we were going to sail to Italy [Italia], they gave Paul and some other bound men over to a centurion called Julius, of the army of His Majesty. 2 We went into a ship from Adramyttium which was going to sail from the coast of Asia. We sailed away, and with us was Aristarchus the Macedonian, from Thessalonica. 3 And on the following day we reached Sidon [Q: to Sidon], and Julius showed kindness [lisse: grace] to Paul and allowed him to go to his friends and receive their comfort.
	4 And we sailed away from there and went under the shelter of Cyprus, since the winds were against us. 5 And after we sailed through the open sea [eare] by Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to port in Myra in Lycia. 6 But the centurion found a ship from Alexandria that was going to sail to Italy, and he commanded us to go into that. 7 After sailing slowly for a sufficient number of days and coming to Cnidus with difficulty, since we had the wind in our face, we sailed under the shelter of Crete at Salmone, 8 and sailing difficultly by the shore we came to a place called Fair Havens, near to the city [of] Lasea.
	9 A long time was gone, and now [there] was danger in traveling on sea, for even the Fast was past. Therefore Paul spoke about what he thought was the best, 10 saying to them: “Men, I perceive that sailing will bring destruction, and much will be lost to you, not concerning the goods and the ship alone, but also concerning our lives.” 11 But the centurion heeded the captain and the man who owned the ship more than the things that Paul said. 12 The haven was not good for remaining through the winter, and therefore the greater number [amarimbar = most numerous] thought that it was better to sail away from there, if in this or that manner it was possible for them to reach as far as Phoenix and remain there through the winter. That is a haven of Crete that is open towards the north-east and south-east.
	13 Furthermore, when the wind from the south blew they thought that their goal was in their reach, and they pulled up the anchor and sailed along the coast of Crete. 14 But after not a long time a stormwind, that which is called Euroaquilo, came rushing from the island. 15 The ship was seized and could not keep its prow against the wind, and we stopped trying to control it and were carried [along]. 16 When we came into the shelter of a small island called Cauda, we could with difficulty save the boat [= the skiff, the lifeboat]. 17 After we lifted it into the ship we used the emergency equipment [maure-sorastar] and bound around the ship with ropes. Our fear was that the ship was going to hit the hidden rocks in Syrte; therefore they took down the front sail and were carried [along]. 18 But the storm lay extremely heavy upon us, and on the following day they threw the goods [= the cargo] into the sea, 19 and on the third day with their own hands they threw the equipment of the ship into the sea.
	20 When we did not see the Sun or stars for many [24-hour] days, and no small storm lay upon us, all hope of our salvation faded. 21 And after a long time when they did not eat food, Paul arose among them and said: “Men, you did better if you [had] listened to me, not going away from Crete, but escaping this destruction and loss. 22 But now I exhort you: Have courage, for [there] is not a single person among you who will be lost! Only the ship will be. 23 For in this night [there] stood beforeme an angel of the God whose servant I am, and whom I worship. 24 He said: 'Do not fear, Paul! It is necessary for you to stand before the High King, and behold! God has given you all that are sailing with you.' 24 Therefore have courage, men, for I believe what God said [lit. God's saying], that the matter will be just as has been told me. 26 But we will be thrown onto the beach of some [lit. one] island.”
	27 When the fourteenth night fell and we were thrown hither and thirther on the Sea of Adria, in the middle of the night the sailors supposed that they were [Q: are] coming near to some [lit. one] land. 28 And they measured how deep the sea was and found that it was twenty fathoms. They went a short way forward and measured again, and they found fifteen fathoms. 29 And since we feared that perhaps we were going to strike the rocks, they threw into the sea four anchors from the rear of the ship and longed for the coming of day. 30 But the sailors, seeking to escape from the ship, put the boat on the sea, saying that they were going to hang [Q: will hang] anchors from the prow. 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: “If these men do not remain on the ship, it is not possible for you to be saved!” 32 Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat and let it float way.
	33 When day was near, Paul encouraged all that they were to eat, saying: “Today is the fourteenth day when you are waiting without food, for you have eaten nothing. 34 Therefore I ask of you that you will eat food, for that will help your rescue. For a single hair on the head of anyone among you will not be lost.”
35 After saying these words he took a bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke it and began to eat. 36 Then they had joy, and they as well ate food. 37 Our total number on the ship was two hundred and seventy-six. 38 After eating the food that we wanted, we made the ship less heavy by throwing the grain into the sea.
	39 When day came, they did not know the land, but they saw a bay where [there] was a beach, and they wanted to bring the ship thither, if it was possible for them. 40 Therefore they cut away the anchors and let them fall into the sea, and at the same time they loosened the lashes of the rudder. Then they raised the forward sail towards the wind and went against the beach.
41 When they fell upon a place where the sea struck from both directions, they brought the ship onto ground. The prow was fixed and could not move, but the back of the ship was broken into pieces by the violence of the sea. 42 Then the soldiers wanted to kill the bound men, to stop anyone from escaping by swimming away. 43 But the centurion wished to bring Paul to safety and stopped them from doing what they wanted. And he commanded those that knew [how] to swim that they were to jump into the sea, in order to reach to land first. 44 The others followed, some on planks, some on things from the ship. And thus all were brought safely to land.
CHAPTER 28
After we reached safety we learnt that the name of the island was Melite [= Malta?]. 2 And the people there, who spoke a language that we did not understand, behaved towards us with kindness [lisse = grace, sweetness] beyond what is usual, for they kindled a fire and received us all, by reason of the rain that fell, and of the cold.
	3 But when Paul collected a bunch of sticks and put them on the fire, a snake came out because of the heat and fastened itself to his hand. 4 When the people there saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to the other: “Surely this man is a murderer, and although he was saved from the sea, doom did not allow him to live.” 5 But he shook the venomous creature into the fire and suffered nothing bad. 6 But they thought that he was going to swell, or that suddenly he was going to fall dead. After waiting long and seeing nothing bad happening to him, they changed their mind and said that he was [Q: is] a god.
	7 Near to that place the most prominent man of the island, called Poplio [Publius], had some fields. He received us well and kindly allowed us to dwell in his house for [ter = through] three days. 8 But Poplio's father was bed-ridden with fever [úre: heat] and dystentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, put his hands on him and healed him.
9 After that happened, the other people on the island that had illnesses also came to him and were healed. 10 Thereafter they also glorified us with numerous gifts, and when we sailed away, they gave us things for our needs.
	11 After three months we sailed away on a ship that came from Alexandria. It had remained through the winter on the island, and it had the Twins as the figurehead [lango-emma: prow-image]. 12 We came to Syracus and remained there for [ter = through] three days. 13 From there we went aroud the coast and came to Rhegium, and after one day [there] was a wind from the south, and we arrived in Puteoli on the second day. 14 There we found brothers who requested that we would stay with them for seven days, and thus we came into Rome. 15 And from there the brothers, when they heard the news about us, came to see us as far as Forum Appii and the Three Taverns. Paul, seeing them, gave thanks to God and had courage.
16 When we came into Rome [it] was permitted to Paul to dwell privately, with the soldier watching him. 17 But after three days he summoned [those] who were among the prominent men of the Jews. After they assembled he said to them: “Men, brothers, though I did nothing against the people or the customs from our fathers, I was given over from Jerusalem into [the] hands of [the] Romans. 18 They, after making an inquiry, wished to free me, since [there] was not [any] guilt worthy of death in me. 19 But when the Jews spoke against that, it was necessary for me to put my case before the High King – but not as if I have anything evil to say against my nation. 20 For this reason I therefore requested to see you and to speak to you, for by reason of the hope of Israel I am carrying this chain.” 21 They said to him: “We have not received letters about you from Judea; furthermore; no one of the brothers that have come have said anything bad about you. 22 But we think it is proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for indeed we know about this sect [heren, order] that in every place one speaks against it.”
	23 They fixed a day when they were going to see him and came to where he lived, more numerous than they were the first time. From morning to evening he told and witnessed to them about God's kingdom, and from the Law and from the prophets he tried to give them understanding about Jesus. 24 Some among them listened to his words, but others failed to believe. 25 Since they were split they went away, but Paul said a single saying to them: “Truly the Holy Spirit spoke to your fathers through Isaiah the Prophet, 26 saying: 'Go to this people and say: Indeed you will hear, but you will by no means understand, and indeed you will look, but you will by no means see. 27 For the heart of this people has become blunt, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed – stopping them from perceiving with their eyes and from hearing with their ears and from understanding with their heart and from finding repentance [inwis: change of mind], for me to heal them.' 28 Therefore, may it be known to you that this salvation has been sent to the nations; they will also hear.” 29 And after he said these words, the Jews went away, having a great dispute among themselves.
	30 Then he remained for two years in the house where he paid to live, and he received all that came to him, 31 making God's kingdom known and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without anyone stopping him.CHAPTER 1
My first account, glorious Theophilus, I wrote about all the things that Jesus started to do and to teach, 2 until the day when he was taken up, after he gave commands to the apostles that he chose. 2 To them he also showed himself alive with many signs after he suffered, being seen by them through forty days, making known the things that concern God's kingdom. 4 And at his meetings with them he gave them the commands: “Do not go away from Jerusalem, but remain, waiting for that [ta-n] about which the Father gave his promise, and about which you heard from me. 5 For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit not many days from now.”
	Now when they were assembled, they asked him: “Lord, do you renew the kingdom for Israel at this time?” 7 He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times and moments which the Father has placed in his own power, 8 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit shall come to you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and the entire Judea and Samaria alike, and to the farthest part of the earth.”
	9 And after he said these things, while they were watching, he was being lifted up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes [dual]. 10 And while they looked up into heaven when he went away, behold! two men in white garments stood by them, 11 and they [dual] said: “Men from Galilee, how is [it] that you are standing looking at heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into the cloud, shall return so, in the same manner that you watched him go into heaven.”
	Then they went back into Jerusalem from the mountain called Mount of Olives, which is near to Jerusalem, around a sabbath's journey away. 13 Then, after going inside, they went up into the upper hall where they dwelt, Peter and John and Jacob and Andrew, Philip and Thomas and Matthew, Jacob son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zelot, and Judas son of Jacob. 14 All among them were steadfast in prayer, with some women and Mary mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
	15 Now in those days Peter arose out of the middle of the brothers – the crowd was around hundred and twenty persons – and said: “Men, brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be made true, that which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand through David's mouth about Judas, who showed the way for those that seized Jesus. 17 For he was counted among us and received a part in this ministry.” 18 (This man got a field for the reward of unrighteousness, and falling with a headlong movement he burst in the middle, and all his entrails poured out of him. 19 That became known to all that dwelt in Jerusalem, and therefore that field was called in their tongue Aceldama, which means: Field of Blood.)
	20 “For [it] has been written in the Book of Psalms: 'May his home be empty, and may no one live there', and: 'His place of oversight let another take.' 21 Therefore it is necessary for us to choose one of the men that came together with us through[out] the entire time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out [ettenna, to outside] among us, 22 from the beginning when John was baptizing and until the day when he was received up from us. For a person among them it is necessary to be a witness with us about his resurrection.”
	23 And they led forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who had the nickname Justus, and Matthias. 24 And they prayed and said: “You, Lord who know the hearts of all, make known who you have chosen 25 to receive the ministry and place as apostle which Judas abandoned to go to his own place.” 26 And they threw lots about them, and the lot indicated Matthias, and he was counted among the eleven apostles.
CHAPTER 2 
When the day of the festival of Seven Weeks was come, they were all together in one place, 2 and suddenly [rincinen, lit. 'with a sudden move'] [there] came from heaven a noice as of a blowing violent wind, and they filled the entire house in which they were. 3 And tongues as of fire being distributed appeared to them, and it settled [lit. sat down] on everyone among them. 4 Then all among them were filled with Holy Spirit and began to speak in various tongues, as the Spirit gave to them to talk.
	5 And [there] were in Jerusalem Jews dwelling there, pious men, from every country under heaven. 6 Thus, when this noise occurred, the host assembled and was confused, for everyone aming them heard them speak in his own tongue. 7 They were startled and in wonder, saying: “Behold, all these people that are speaking are from Galilee, no?
8 And yet how is [it] that we are hearing, everyone among us, his own tongue that we are born in? 9 People from Parthea ar Media and Elam, people that dwell in Mesopotamia, Judea and Capadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10 and Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the regions of Libya, near to Cyrene, and [those] that have come from Rome, Jews and converted ones alike, 10 people from Crete and Arabia – we are hearing them speak in our own tongues about God's great deeds!” 12 They were beside themselves with wonder and understood nothing, saying one to the other: “What is this thing?” 13 But others, in mockery against them, said: “They are full of sweet wine!”
	But Peter arose with the twelve and raised his voice and said to them: “Men from Judea and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, may this be known to you, and listen to my sayings: 15 These men are not full of wine as you suppose, for this is the third hour of the day. 16 On the contrary, this is [that] which was spoken though Joel the Prophet: 17 'And in the last days,' God says, 'I will pour [some] of my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will speak like prophets, and your young men will see visions, and  your old men will dream dreams [lit. for your old men [it] will be dreamt with dreams], 18 and also upon my male and female thralls I shall pour [some] of my spirit in those days, and they will speak as prophets. 19 And I will give signs in heaven above you and portents on earth below, blood and fire and mist of smoke; 20 The Sun will become darkness and the Moon will become blood, before the Lord's great and mighty day shall come. 21 And everyone who calls upon [or 'by', -nen] the Lord's name will be saved.
	22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus from Nazareth, a man that God put before you with mighty deeds and signs and portents which God did by him in your midst, as you know, 23 this man, as a person given over, by God's firm plan and the knowledge that he had beforehand, you fastened on a cross by the hand of lawless ones and killed him. 24 But God raised him by loosening the bonds of death, for it was not possible for death to keep him. 25 For David says concerning him: 'I always saw the Lord before my eyes, for he is by my right hand, to stop me from being shaken. 26 Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue spoke about great joy. Furthermore, also my flesh will dwell in hope, 27 for you will not abandon my soul in Mandos [/Hades], also you will not allow your faithful one to see a corrupt state. 28 You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy from your face.'
	29 Men, brothers, it is me allowed to speak freely to you about the patriarch David, that he expired and was brought to his grave, and his tomb is among us until this day. 30 Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God gave him a promise about placing on his throne a person of the fruit of his loins, 31 he had foresight and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned in Mandos [= Hades]; furthermore, his flesh did not see a corrupt state. 32 This Jesus God resurrected, about which [fact] all among us are witnesses. 33 Therefore, since he was raised to God's right hand and received the Holy Spirit from his Father by the promise he [= the Father] had given, he poured forth this that you are seeing and you are hearing. 34 For David did not ascend to heaven, but he himself says: 'The Lord said to my lord: Sit by my right hand, 35 until I shall place your enemies as a support for your feet.' 36 Therefore may the entire kin of Israel know that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus that you crucified.”
	37 When they heard that they were cut in their heart, and they said to Peter and to the other apostles: “Men, brothers, what are we to do?” 38 Peter said to them: “Find repentance, and may everyone among you be baptized by the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of Holy Spirit. 39 For for you is the promise, and for your children and for [those] that are far away – all that the Lord our God will call to himself.” 40 And with many other words he witnessed for them and urged them, saying: “Be saved from this perverse generation!” 41 Therefore [those] that received his word were baptized, and on that day around three thousand souls were added. 42 And they were steadfast in the teaching of the apostles and the brotherhood, in the breaking of the bread and in the prayers. 
	43 Fear fell upon everyone, and numerous wonders and signs happened through the apostles. 44 All that believed were together in having everything common, 45 and they sold their goods and the fields that they possessed and distributed the money to all, by anyone's need. 46 And 
day after day they were in the temple, being of one mind, and they broke bread in the houses, eating their food in joy and having a pure heart, 47 praising God and having the grace [or, good will] of the entire people, while every day the Lord was adding to them [those] that were saved.
CHAPTER 3
Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. 2 And a man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried thither, and they put him every day beside the gate of the temple that was called the Beautiful, for him to ask gifts of mercy from those that were going into the temple.
3 When he saw Peter and John going towards the temple, he asked from them gifts of mercy. 4 But Peter, with John, looked at him and said: “Look at us!” 5 Therefore he fixed his eyes on them, thinking that he was going to [Q: will] receive something from them. 6 But Peter said: “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have I give to you: By the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!” 7 And he seized him in his right hand and raised him up. In the same moment his soles [dual] and the joints between foot and leg became firm, 8 and he jumped up and walked, and he went with them into the temple, walking and jumping and praising God. 9 And the entire people saw him walking and praising God. 10 Furthermore, they knew who he was, that he was the man who beforehand sat to receive gifts of mercy by the Fair Gate in the temple, and they were filled with wonder and were beside themselves by [that] which had happened to him.
11 When the man stuck to Peter and John, the entire people, being startled, ran together to them in the place called the Columnade of Solomon.  12 Seeing that, Peter said to the people: “Men of Israel, how is [it] that you are in wonder about this, and what is your reason for looking at us as if by our own power or by our godliness we have caused him to walk? 13 The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has made Jesus his servant glorious, him that you gave over and denied before the face of Pilate, though he wanted to free him. 14 You denied the holy and just [one], and you requested that you were to receive a man who was a murderer, 15 but you killed the Chief of life. But God raised him from [the] dead, of which all among us are witnesses. 16 Therefore, by our faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, him whom you look at and whom you know, and the faith which is through him has given him health before your eyes. 
17 And now, brothers, I know that you did so in lack of knowledge, as your rulers also did. 18 But thus God has made true the things that beforehand he made known through the mouth of all his heralds [= prophets]: that his Christ was going to suffer.
	19 Therefore find repentence and turn yourselves [around]! Then your sins will be wiped away, allowing times of refreshment to come from the face of the Lord. 20 Thus he will send the Christ appointed to you, Jesus, 21 whom it is necessary for heaven to keep until the times of renewal of all things, of which God spoke by the mouth of his holy heralds [/prophets], of old. 22 Indeed Moses said: “The Lord your God will raise [up] among your brothers, like me.
23 Indeed every person who does to listen to that prophet will be destroyed from his people.” 24 And all the prophets, from Samuel to those that followed him – all that have spoken – have also made known these days. 25 You are sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God established with your fathers, saying to Abraham: 'And in your seed all the families of earth will be blessed.' 26 After God raised his Son, to you he first sent him to bless you, by turning everyone away from your wicked deeds.”
CHAPTER 4
While they [dual] talked to the people, the chief priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them, 2 being angry since they instructed the people and made know the resurrection from the dead by Jesus. 3 And they [plural] put their hands on them [dual] and put them in gaol until the following day, for evening had come.
	4 But numerous ones among [those] that heard the word believed. And the number of the men rose as far [or, high] as five thousands.
	5 It happened [lit. came] on the following day that the rulers and the elders and the scribes in Jerusalem assembled, 6 with Annas the chief priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all that were of the kin of the chief priest. 7 After putting them in their midst they asked: “By what power and by whose name did you [dual] do this thing?” 8 Then Peter, full of Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers of the people and elders, 9 if we [dual exclusive] are on this day investigated about a good deed to an ailing man, and you want to know by whom this man has received his health, 10 may it be known to all among you and to the entire people of Israel that it happened by the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, whom you crucified but God raised out of [the] dead. By him this man is standing here before you in health. 
11 This is the rock which was counted as nothing by you that built, which has been made the head of the corner. 12 For [there] is no salvation by anyone else, for also there is not [/neither is there] given [any] other name by which it is necessary for us to be saved.” 
	13 When they saw how freely Peter and John spoke, and knew that they [dual] were unlettered and ordinary men, they were filled with wonder, since they also knew them as people that were with Jesus. 14 When they [pl.] saw the man that stood with them [dual], he who received health, they [pl.] had nothing to say against them [dual]. 15 Therefore, after commanding them to go out from the council, they made a consideration together, 16 saying: “What are we to do to these men? For a sign which people know [about] has happened through them, easy to see to all that dwell in Jerusalem, and it is not possible for us to deny it. 17 But to stop it from being spread more widely in the people, let us rebuke them [dual], that they are not to speak more by this name to anyone.”
18 And after calling them they commanded them that it was necessary for them to completely cease to speak and teach by the name of Jesus. 19 But in answer Peter said to them: “If [/whether] it is just in God's eyes to listen to you and not to God, you judge for yourselves! 20 But we [dual] cannot cease to speak about [the things] that we have seen and we have heard.” 21 After they [pl.] spoke more to them [dual] with sharp words they released them, since they [pl.] did not find a reason for punishing them [dual], and by reason of the people, for all among them gave glory to God about [that] which had happened. 22 For the man on which this sign of healing had happened had [an age of] more than forty years. 
23 And after they [dual] were released they went to their [dual] own and told them about the things which the chief priests and elders had said to them [dual]. 24  Hearing that, with one mind they raised their voice to God and said: “Master, you are [the one] who made heaven and earth and [the things] that are exist in them [dual], 25 and who by Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David our father, your servant: 'How is [it] that nations rise up up and peoples are thinking about empty things? 26 The kings of earth have taken stand and the rulers have assembled as one, against the Lord and against his Christ.' 27 For indeed they assembled in this city, Herod and Pontius Pilate and people of the nations, against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, 28 to do [the things] that by your hand and by your choice you have beforehand established were going to happen. 29 And now, Lord, notice their threats, and allow your servants to speak your word with all boldness, 30 when you reach out with your hand to heal, and when signs and portents happen by the name of your holy servant, Jesus.
31 And after they said the request, the place where they were assembled was being shaken, and everyone among them was filled by the Holy Spirit and spoke God's word with boldness.
	32 Furthermore, the multitude of those that believed had one mind and spirit, and no one among them said about anything that he had that that was his own, but they possessed all things in common [uo: together]. 33 And with great power the apostles gave out their witness about the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and great grace lay upon all among them. 34 Indeed [there] was no one having need among them, for all that had fields or houses sold them and brought the money that they got for the sold things 35 and put that before the feet of the apostles. Then one distributed to everyone was their need was. 36 Thus Joseph, who from the apostles received the nickname Barsabba – which means Son of Comfort – one of the Levites, born at Cyprus, 37 who had a field, sold it and brought the money and put it before the feet of the apostles.
CHAPTER 5
But a man whose name was Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a field that he had 2 and secretly kept a part of the money that he got, as his wife also knew. He brought only a part and put it before the feet of the apostles. 3 But Peter said: “Ananias, how is [it] that Satan has given you boldness to lie to the Holy Spirit and put away for yourself a part of the money that you got for the field? 4 While you possessed it, was it not your own? And after it was sold, could you not still choose what you were going to do? What is your reason for doing such a deed? You have lied, not to men, but to God!” 5 When he heard these words, Ananias fell down and expired. And a great fear came upon all that heard it. 6 But the young men rose up, wrapped him in clothes, and carried him outside to his grave.
	7 After three hours his wife came inside, not knowing [that] which had happened. 8 Peter said to her: “Tell me, did you [dual] sell the field for this sum?” She said: “Yes, that was the sum.” 9 But Peter said to her: “How is [it] that you [dual] were of one mind to test the Lord's spirit? Behold! The feet [dual] of [those] that brought your husband to his grave are [dual] before the door, and they [pl.] will carry you outside.” 10 In the same moment she fell down before Peter's feet [dual] and expired. Whent he young men came inside, they found her dead, and they carried her outside and gave her a grave beside her husband. 11 Therefore great fear came upon the entire congregation and upon all that heard about these things.
	12 Furthermore, through the hands [dual] of the apostles numerous signs and portents happened among the people, and all among them assembled in Solomon's columnade, being of one mind. 13 No one of the others dared to join himself to them, and yet the people praised them.
14 Furthermore, persons that belived in the Lord were added, multitudes of men [ner-li > nelli] and women alike. 15 Therefore they brought the sick ones outside and put them there on small beds and on biers, wishing only that Peter, when he passed by, was going to [Q: will] cast shadow on some people among them. 16 And the multitude from the cities surrounding Jerusalem assembled, carrying sick ones and [those] that were being tormented by unclean spirits, and everyone among them was healed.
	17 But the chief priest and [those] that were with him, the order of the Sadducees that existed then, arose and were filled with envy, 18 and they laid hands [dual] upon the apostles and put them in the city gaol. 19 But in the night the Lord's angel opened the gates of the gaol, brought them outside and said: 20 “Go, and standing in the temple speak to the people all the sayings about this life!” 21 After they heard that, they went at dawn into the temple and taught.
	When the chief priest and [those] that were with him came, they assembled the High Council and the entire council of the sons of Israel, and they sent them to the gaol to bring them. 22 But when the officers came thither, they did not find them in the gaol. After returning they told: 23 “The gaol we found shut with all security, and the guards standing by the doors, but when we opened the gaol we did not find anyone on the inside.” 24 When the captain of the temple and the chief priest alike heard these words, they were uncertain about these things and about what was going to happen because of [-nen] this matter. 25 But a man came and told them: “Behold! The men that you put in the gaol are in the temple, standing and instructing the people!” 26 Then the captain went away with his officers and brought them, but without violence, since they feared [Q; feared from] that the peope would [Q; will] kill them with stones.
27 They brought them and put them before the High Council. And the chief priest said: “We gave you the command: Cease to teach in this name! And yet, behold! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to bring this man's blood upon us!” 29 In answer Peter and the other apostles said: “It is necessary for us to follow God's commands over those of men. 30 The God of your fathers raised [up] Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. 31 God raised him to his right hand as Chief and Saviour, in order to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are witnesses about these matters, as is the Holy Spirit, that God gave to [those] that listen to his commands.”
	33 When they heard that, they felt wounded and wished to kill them. 34 But [there] was a man who arose in the High Council, a Pharisee whose name was Gamaliel, a law-teacher dear to the entire people. He commanded: “Lead the men to the outside for a short time.”
35 Then he said to them: “Men of Israel, give heed to yourselves concerning what you want to do to these men. 36 For before these days Theudas arose, saying that he was important, and a number of men, around four hundred, went with him. But he was slain, and all that heeded his commands were scattered and undone. 37 After him Judas from Galilee arose, in the days in which the people was counted, and he drew away some people after himself. And yet that man died, and all that heeded his commands were scattered. 38 And as things stand now, I say to you: Let these men be and do not trouble them, for if this matter or things doing is from men, it will be undone, 39 but if it is from God, you will not be able to undo them. Watch yourselves, that you will not be found fighting against God!”
40 Then they gave heed to what he said. After summoning the apostles they flayed them and commanded them: “Do not speak in the name of Jesus!” Then they allowed them to go.
	41 They, therefore, went away from the High Council in joy, since they were counted worthy to suffer mockery for the sake of the name. 42 And every day, in the temple and in the houses, they did not cease to make known the gospel about Jesus Christ.
CHAPTER 6
But in those days, while the number of disciples rose, the Hellenists were grumbling against the Hebrews, since their widows were not heeded in the daily distribution. 2 Therefore the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples to themselves and said: “It is not good for us to abandon God's word to distribute food at the tables. 3 Therefore, brothers, seek among yourselves seven men that have good witness, full of spirit and wisdom, and we will set them to cover this need, 4 but we will still give yourselves to the praying and to the service of the Word.”
5 And what they said seemed good to the entire multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of Holy Spirit, and Philip and Procorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch, 6 and they put them before the apostles, and after praying they placed their hands on them.
	7 And God's word grew, and the number of the disciples rose quickly in Jerusalem, and a huge crowd of priests subjected themseves [lit. put themselves under] the faith.
	8 But Stephen, full of grace and of power, made mighty signs and portents among the people. 9 But [there] arose some men from the synagogue called [the synagogue] of [the] Freed Ones, and some people that came from Cyrene and Alexandria, to quarrel with Stephen. 10 But they  could not stand against the wisdom and the spirit with which he talked. 11 Then secretly they made some men say: “We have heard him speak blasphemies against Moses and God.”
12 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they fell upon him and seized him, and they brought him into the High Council. 13 And they called lying witnesses, that said: “This man does not cease to speak words against this holy place and against the Law. 14 And we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will throw down this place and will change the customs that we have received from Moses.”
	15 And when all that were sitting in the High Council looked at him, they saw that his face was like an angel's face.
CHAPTER 7
But the chief priest said: “Are these matters so?” 2 He said: “Men, brothers and fathers, hear! The God of Glory showed himself to Abraham our father while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, 3 and he said to him: 'Go away from your land and from your kin and come to the place that I will show you.'
4 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God caused him to move to this land in which you now dwell. 5 And yet he did not give him an heir's part in it, also [/even]not the earth under his foot-sole, but he gave him the promise that he was going to give it to him for him to possess it, and after him to his seed, while he still lacked [any] child. 6 Futhermore, this God said, that his seed was going to dwell like exiles in a foreign nation [or, land/country], and the people were going to make them thralls and were going to cause them affliction, through[out] four hundred years. 7 And 'the country [/nation] for which they will be thralls I shall judge,' said God, 'and thereafter they will go forth and will do service [núromolie: servant-work] for me in this place.' 8 And he gave him a covenant of circumcision, and thus he begat Isaac and circumcized him on the eight day, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve family heads [nossetúri: kin-rulers].
9 And the family heads, full of envy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him, 10 and he delivered him out of all his tribulations and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he put him [in office] to rule Egypt and his entire house. 11 But famine came upon he entire land of Egypt and Canaan, indeed a great tribulation, and our fathers did not find food. 12 But Jacob heard that [there] was food in Egypt, and he sent our fathers the first time. 13 And at the second time Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and Jospeh's kin was made known to Pharaoh. 14 Sending a message, Joseph summoned Jacob his father and all his kin, seventy-five people. 15 Jacob went down into Egypt. And he expired, as did our fathers, 16 and they were brought to Shechem and were put in the tomb that Abraham got from the sons of Hamor for a sum of silver [or, money].
	17 When the time came near for the promise which God made known to Abraham, the people grew and rose to a great number in Egypt, 18 until another king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 19 He used cunning against our fathers and did evil do them, compelling them to put their babies out, for them to die. 20 At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God, and he was kept for [ter = through] three months in his father's house. 21 But when he was put outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and raised him as her own son. 22 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of Egypt, and he was mighty in his words and his deeds.
	23 When he had [an age of] forty years, [it] came into his heart that he would look to his brothers, the sons of Israel. 24 And when he saw a man who suffered injustice, he protected him and gave revenge to the one that suffered violence, by striking down the Egyptian.
22 He supposed that his brothers were going to understand that God would [Q: will] give them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand it. 26 And on the following day he came to them while they fought, and he tried again to bring them together in peace, saying: 'Men, you are brothers! How is [it] that you do injustice one to the other?' 27 But [he] who was injust [unfair, behaving wrong] to his neighbor pushed him away, saying: 'Who made you chief and judge over us [dual]? 28 Perhaps you intend to kill me, like you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' 29 Because of this word Moses ran away and dwelt in the land of Midian, where two sons were born to him.
	30 And when forty years were gone, an angel showed himself to him in the wilderness by Mount Sinai, in the fiery flame of a thorn-bush. 31 When Moses saw it, what he saw filled him with wonder. But when he went near to examine [it], the Lord's voice came: 32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaak and Jacob.' Then trembling seized Moses, and he did not dare to examine [any] further [ambe = more]. 
33 The Lord said to him: 'Take your shoes from [/off] your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground. 34 I have indeed seen the evil done to my people in Egypt, and I have heard their moaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.' 35 This Moses that they turned away, saying: 'Who made you chief or judge?', this man God sent as chief and deliverer alike, by the hand of the angel that showed himself to him in the thornbush. 36 This man led them out after he did signs and portents in Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for [ter = through] forty years.
	37 Thus Moses spoke to the Sons of Israel: 'God will raise [up] for you out of your brothers a prophet like me.' 38 He is [the one] that was among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with your fathers, and he received living sayings to give to us.
39 To his commands our fathers refused to listen, but they pushed him away and turned themselves in their heart to Egypt, 40 saying to Aaron: 'Make for us gods that can go before us! For this Moses, who led us out of Egypt – we do not know what has happened to him.'
	41 Therefore they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and they had joy by the work of their hands. 42 But God turned himself and gave them over to serving the host of heaven, as has been written in the book of the prophets: 'Surely you did not give me gifts and sacrifices for [ter = through] forty years in the wilderness, House of Israel? 43 But you carried the tent of Moloch and the star of Rephan your god, the images that you made to worship them. Therefore I will take you away, beyond Babel [= Babylon].'
	44 Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, like [he] who spoke to Moses commanded that one was to make it, according to the image that Moses saw. 45 And our fathers that received it brought it with Joshua into the land being possessed by the peoples that God threw out before our fathers. There it remained until David's days. 46 He found grace before God and requested that he would [Q: will] give Jacob's God a place for dwelling. 47 But Solomon was [the one] that built him a house. 48 And yet the Highest does not dwell in houses made with hands, like the prophet says: 49 'Heaven is my throne, and earth a support for my feet. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is my place for resting? 50 Or was not my hand what made all these things?'
	51 O thrawn ones, uncircumcized in heart and ears, you always stand against the Holy Spirit; like your fathers, so also you! 52 Who among the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they slew [those] who beforehand made known the coming of the Just One, whom you have now given over and you have slain, 53 you who received the Law as given through angels, but you have not kept it.  
	54 When they heard these things they were cut in their heart, and they ground their teeth against him. 55 But he, full of Holy Spirit, looked into heaven and saw God's glory, and Jesus stand by God's right hand. 56 And he said: “Behold, I see heaven opened, and the Son of Man stand by God's right hand.” 57 But they cried with a mighty voice and stopped their ears, and they went rushing together upon him.
58 And after they threw him out of the city they threw stones at him. And the witnesses put away their clothes by a young man whose name was Saul. 59 And they threw stones at Stephen while he was praying and saying: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” 60 Then he fell upon his knees [dual] and cried with a loud voice: “Lord, do not count this sin against them!” And after saying that, he expired.
CHAPTER 8
Saul assented to the murder of him. 
	On that day a great persecution arose against the congregation which was in Jerusalem; all except the apostles were scattered through[out] the regions of Judea and Samaria. 2 But some men who feared God carried Stephen to his grave, and they made a great lamentation for him. 3 But Saul fell upon the congregation in an extremely harsh manner. Going into house after house and dragging outside men and women alike, he threw them into prison.
	4 But those that were scattered went through the land, making known the gospel about the Word. 5 Philip went down into the city of Samaria and made the Christ known to them. 6 With one mind the crowds heeded the things being spoken by Philip while they listened and watched the signs that he did. 7 And there were numerous ones that had unclean spirits [in them], and they went out crying with a mighty voice. Furthermore, many that were lame and impeded were healed. 8 Therefore [there] was much joy in that city.
	9 But [there] was in the city a man called Simon, who beforehand did magic and startled the nation of Samaria, saying about himself that he was a great person. 10 And all among them, from the least to the greatest, gave heed to him and said: “This man is God's power, which is called Great.” 11 Therefore they gave heed to him, since for [ter = through] a long time he had caused them to marvel with his magic. 12 But when they believed the sayings of Philip, who made known God's kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, men and women alike.
13 Also Simon believed, and after being baptized he remained with Philip and was being filled with wonder when he watched the sings and mighy deeds that happened.
	14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had [Q: has] received God's word, they sent Peter and John to them. 15 They [dual] went down and prayed for them [pl.] to receive Holy Spirit. 16 For still it had not fallen upon them, but they were solely baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 Then they [dual] put their hands on them [pl.], and they [pl.] received Holy Spirit.
	18 Now when Simon saw how the spirit was being given by putting hands [on people], he put silver-pieces before them, 19 saying: “Give also to me this power, that anyone on whom I put my hands will receive Holy Spirit.” 20 But Peter said to him: “May your silver and you be destroyed together, since you thought that you were going to possess God's gift for money!”
21 You do not have a part or a portion in this matter, for your heart is not straight before God. 22 Therefore find repentance concerning this wickedness, and ask of the Lord that your heart's thought will be forgiven you, 23 for I see that you are a poisonous gall and a bond of unrighteousness.” 24 In answer Simon said: “You make request of the Lord for me, to stop the things of which you spoke from coming upon me.”
	25 Thus, after they gave a full witness and speaking the Lord's word, they returned to Jerusalem, and they made the gospel known in numerous villages of the Samareans.
	26 But the Lord's angel spoke to Philip, saying: “Rise and go southwards to the road that goes down from Jerusalem into Gaza.” That is in the wilderness.
27 And he arose and went, and behold! there came a minister [arandur, king's servant] from Ethiopia, a mighty man under Candace, queen of the people of Ethiopia. He had gone to Jerusalem to give worship, 28 but he returned and sat in his cart reading Isaiah the prophet. 29 And the Spirit said to Philip: “Go near to the cart and stick to it!” 30 Philip ran beside it and heard him read Isaiah the prophet, and he said: “Do you truly understand what you read?” 31 He said: “How will it be possible for me to understand when I lack anyone who will show me what it means?” And he requested of Philip to come into the cart to sit with him. 33 But the part of the scripture that he read was this: “Like a sheep he was being brought to the slaughter, and like a lamb that is voiceless before [the one] ho cuts off its wool, he did not open his mouth. 33 In his humiliation the judgement was taken away from him. About his generation who will tell? For his life has been taken away from earth.”
	34 In answer the minister said: “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this? About himself or about another person?” 35 Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture he made known to him the gospel about Jesus. 36 Now while they [dual] went on the road, they came to a place where [there] was water, and the minister said: “Look, water! What stops me form being baptized?” 37 Philip answered: “If you believe with all your heart, that can happen.” 38 And he commanded the cart to halt, and both went into the water, Philip and the minister together, and he baptized him. 39 After they [dual] came up form the water, the Lord's spirit quickly led Philip away, and the miniser did not see him [any]more, and he went on his road in joy. 40 But Philip was found in Asoto [Azotus, Ashdod], and he went through the region and made the gospel known to all the cities until he reached Caesarea.
CHAPTER 9
But Paul, still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the chief priest and asked him for letters [lit. asked from him messages] for the synagogues in Damascus, for him to bring bound to Jerusalem anyone that he found was of the Way, men and women alike.
	3 On his journey, when was coming near to Damascus, suddenly [there] shone around him a light from heaven, 4 and after falling to the ground he heard a voice say to him: “Saul, Saul, what is your reason for persecuting me?” 5 He said: “Who are you, Lord?” He said: “I [am] Jesus, whom you persecute! 6 But rise and come into the city, and [that] which is necessary for you to do will be told to you.”
	7 The men that went with him stood dumb, for they heard the voice, but did not see anyone. 8 But Saul arose from the ground, and though his eyes were open he saw nothing. Therefore they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9 And for three days he saw nothing, and he did not eat or drink.
10 [There] was in Damascus a disciple whose name was Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision: “Ananias!” He said: “Here I am, Lord.” 11 The Lord said to him: “Rise, go to the street called Straigth, and in the house of Judas seek a man called Saul, from Tarsus. For look! he is praying, 12 and he has seen in a vision a man called Ananias come in and put his hands on him, for him to see again.” 12 But Ananias answered: “Lord, I have heard from numerous ones about this man, about all the evil things that he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem. 14 And here he has received power from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.” 15 But the Lord said to him: “Go, for this man is for me a chosen tool, to bear my name to the nations and to kings and to [the] sons of Israel alike. 16 For I will show him everything that it is necessary for him to suffer for my name.”
	17 Then Ananias went, and he came into the house, and he put his hands on him and said: “Saul, brother – the Lord, the Jesus that showed himself to you on the road on which you came, has sent me for your to see again and for you to be filled with Holy Spirit.” 18 And in the same moment [there] fell from his eyes [dual] what seemed like shells, and he could again see, and he arose and was baptized. 19 Then he ate and was strengthened.
	For some days he remained with the disciples in Damascus, 20 and without waiting he made Jesus known in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 21 But all that heard him were filled with wonder and said: “Is this man not [the one] who in Jerusalem destroyed all that call on this name, and who came here for the purpose that he was going to lead them bound to the chief priests? 22 But Saul was being strengthened, and he made the Jesus that dwelt in Damascus wholly confused by showing that Jesus is the Christ.
	23 After a sufficient number of days the Jews made a consideration together, about how they were going to destroy him. 24 But their plan against him became known to Paul. But they also watched the gates closely, day and night alike, to destroy him. 25 Therefore his disciples took him and sent him down by rope in a basket through a hole in the wall.
	26 When he came to Jerusalem he tried to join [lit. unite himself to] the disciples, but all feared him, since they did not believe that he was a disciple. 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he told them everything about how in on the road he saw the Lord, and that he spoke to him, and how in Damascus he spoke with boldness in Jesus' name. 28 And he remained with them, going in and out in Jerusalem, speaking with boldness in the Lord's name, 29 talking and quarreling with the Jews that spoke Greek. But they made plans to destroy him. 30 When the brothers perceived that, they brought him to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
	31 Now the congregation in all of Judea and Galilee had peace and was being built up, and while they walked in fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, their number rose.
	32 Now when Peter went through all regions he came down also to the holy ones that dwelt in Lydda. 33 There he found a man called Aeneas, who had lain on his bier for eight years, since he was lame. 34 And Peter said to him: “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and arrange your bed!” And he arose in the same moment. 35 And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
	36 But in Joppa there was a female disiciple whose name was Tabitha, which means Dorcas [= Gazelle]. She was full of good deeds and gifts of mercy that she did. 37 But in those days she became ill and died. They washed her and put her in the upper room. 38 Since Lydda was near to Joppa, when the disciples heard that Peter was in that city they sent two men to him to request of him: “Do not be late in coming to us!” 39 They Peter arose and went with them. And when he came thither, they led him into the upper room, and all the widows stood with him in tears, showing him many tunics and cloaks that Dorcas made while she was still with them. 40 But Peter sent all outside, fell upon his knees and prayed. Then, after turning [Q: turning himself] to the body, he said: “Tabitha, rise!” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. 41 Peter gave her his hand and raised her [up], and he called the holy ones and the widows and put her before them alive.
	42 This matter became known to all in Joppa, and numerous ones believed in the Lord. 43 For a sufficient number of days he remained in Joppa with a man called Simon, a leather-worker.
CHAPTER 10
There was a man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the army division [hosse-ranta] called the Italian, 2 who was reverent and feared God with his entire family, and he gave many gifts of mercy to the people and was praying to God always. 3 Around the ninth hour he saw in a vision an angel of God come inside to him and saying to him: “Cornelius!” 4 The man looked at him, and being frightened he said: “What do you want, Lord?” He said to him: “Your prayers and your gifts of mercy have ascended like a reminder before God. 5 And now, send some men to Joppa and call a person called Simon, who has the nickname Peter. 6 This man dwells in [the] house of a man whose name is Simon, a leather-worker, who has his house by the sea.”
	7 After the angel who spoke to him went away, he called two of the servants of his house and a reverent soldier from among those that remained with him, 8 and he told them everything and sent them to Joppa.
	9 On the following day, when they were on their journey and were coming near to the city, Peter went up to the roof around the sixth hour, in order to pray. 10 But he was hungry and wanted to eat. While they prepared, he went into a vision 11 and saw heaven opened and some kind of vessel that came down like  a huge sheet of linen, 12 and in it [there] were all kinds of four-legged [beasts] and creeping things and birds of heaven. 13 And a voice came to him: “Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!” 14 But Peter said: “By no means, Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean have I ever eaten!”
15 And the voice said to him a second time: “Do not call defiled [the things] that God has cleansed!” 16 This happened a third time, and then the vessel was taken into heaven.
	17 While Peter was still very uncertain about what the vision that he had seen signified, behold! the men sent by Cornelius stood before the gate after asking their way to the house of Simon. 18 While Peter thought about the vision, the spirit said: “Behold! Three men are seeking you. 20 But go down and follow them, and do not be uncertain about anything, for I have sent them.” 21 Thus Peter went down and said to the men: “Behold, I am [the one] that you are seeking. What is your reason for coming here?”
22 They said: “Cornelius the centurion, a man just and reverent, of whom the whole nation of [the] Jews speak well, has received a command through a holy angel about sending for you, for you to come to his house and for him to hear your sayings.” 23 Then he requested of them to come inside, and he received them as guests.
	On the following day he arose and went with them, and some of the brothers in Joppa went with him. 24 One [24-hour] day thereafter he went into Caesarea. Cornelius, waiting for their coming, beforehand called together the people of his family and his close friends. 25 When Peter went inside, Cornelius met him, fell down before his feet and gave him worship. 26 But Peter raised him [up], saying: “Rise; I as well am a man!” 27 And while he was speaking with him, he entered and found numerous people assembled. 
28 And he said to them: “You know well how to a Jew [it] is wholly against the Law to unite himself to a person of another nation, or to go into his house. And yet God showed me that I am not to call anyone defiled or unclean. 29 Therefore I indeed came, without speaking against your calling when I was being summoned. Therefore I ask: What is your reason for sending to me?”
	30 And Cornelius said: “Four days ago, counting from this hour, I prayed in my house when behold! a man with bright garment stood before me 31 and said: “Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God. 32 Therefore send to Joppa and call [for] Simon, who has the nickname Peter. This man is a guest in the house of another Simon, a leather-worker, by the sea.” 32 Therefore in the same hour I sent [people] to you, and you did well by coming here. And so in this hour all among us are here before God, to hear all the things that the Lord has commanded you to say.”
	34 Then Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I perceive that God does not heed faces [= is not partial], 35 but from every nation he receives well the person that fears him and does righteousness. 36 He sent the word to [the] sons of Israel to make known to them the gospel of peace through Jesus Chrsit; he is Lord of all. 37 You know the saying that went through the entire Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism about which John talked – 38 about Jesus from Nazareth, how God annointed him with Holy Spirit and with power, and he went through the land, doing good deeds and healing all upon which the Devil's power lay heavy, for God was with him. 39 And all among us are witnesses of the things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem alike, but they also killed him by hanging him on a tree. 40 Him God raised on the third day and allowed him to show himself, 
41 not to the entire people, but to witnesses chosen by God – to us, that ate and drank with him after his raising from [the] dead. 42 And he commanded us to make known to the people, and to give them witness, that this man was [the one] whom God has placed as judge of living ones and dead ones. 43 About him all the Prophets spoke – that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins by his name.”
	44 While Peter still was still speaking about these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all that heard the word. 45 And the faithful that had come with Peter, those that were of the circumcision, were filled with wonder since the gift of Holy Spirit was poured [out] also upon non-Jews. 46 And they heard them speak in tongues and praise God. Then Peter said: “Can anyone deny them the water, to stop from being baptized these men that have received the same Holy Spirit that we as well have received?” 48 And he commanded them to be baptized by the name of Jesus Christ. Then they requested of him that he would remain with them for [ter, through] some days.
CHAPTER 11
Now the apostles and the brother that were in Judea heard that some non-Jews also received God's word. 2 But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the people of circumcision quarreled with him, 3 saying that he had gone [Q: went] into the house of men that were not circumcized and had eaten [Q: ate] with them. 4 Then Peter began to tell them everything as it had happened, saying:
	“I was in Joppa city when I saw a vision, a kind of vessel that came down like a huge sheet of linen, being sent down from heaven by its four corners, and it came near to me. 6 Looking into it I watched and saw the four-legged creatures of earth and the wild beasts and the creeping things and the birds of heaven. 7 I also heard a voice say to me: Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!
8 But I said: By no means, Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean has ever come into my mouth! 9 A second time the voice from heaven answered: Do not call unclean [the things] that God has cleansed! 10 This happened a third time, and everthing was drawn back into heaven. 11 And behold! in that moment three men stood by the house that we were in, for they were sent from Caesarea to me. 12 Therefore the spirit commanded me to go with them, not being uncertain about anything. But these six brothers also went with me, and we went into the man's house. 13 He told us how he saw the angel stand in his house, saying: Send some men to Joppa and summon Simon who has the nick-name Peter, 14 and he will speak to you sayings by which you will be saved, you and your family. 15 But when I began to speak, the spirit fell upon them just as it fell also upon us in the beginning.
16 Then I recalled the Lord's saying, how he said: John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit. 17 Therefore, if God gave the same gift to them as to ourselves that have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who am I, that I will be able to stop God?”
	18 Now when they heard these things, they said nothing more against him, and they gave glory to God, saying: “Then God has indeed given repentance leading to life also to non-Jews.”
	19 Therefore [those] that were scattered by the tribulation that arose concerning Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, but they spoke the word only to the Jews. 20 But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene that came to Antioch and talked about the gospel of the Lord Jesus also to [those] that spoke Greek. 21 Furthermore, the Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned themselves to the Lord. 
	22 The story about them came to the ears [dual] of the congregation which was in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch. 23 When he came there and saw God's grace, he had joy and urged them sincerely to remain in God's will, 24 for he was a good man and full of Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great crowd was added to the Lord. 25 Then he went away to Tarsus to seek Saul, 26 and after he found him, he led him to Antioch. Thus it came [about] that for a full year they [dual] assembled with them in the congregation and taught a huge crowd, and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians [Hristonduri, Christ-servants].
	27 In those days [there] came prophets down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 One among them, whose name was Agabus, arose and made known by the Spirit that [there] was going to come a great famine upon the entire world. That indeed came in the days of Claudius. 29 Therefore [those] that had more than their need chose to send assistance [mána: a boon] to the brothers that were in Judea. 30 And so they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
CHAPTER 12 
Around that time Herod the King laid hands on some persons of the congregation, to evil to them. 2 He killed Jacob, the brother of Jacob, by sword. 3 Seeing how the Jews thought well about that, he also seized Peter. That happened in the days of unleavened breads. 4 After he seized him, he put him in prison, giving him into the hands of four groups, each having four soldiers, for he intended to show him to the people. 5 Thus Peter was kept in prison, but the entire congregation was intensely [veassenen: with vigour] praying to God for him. 
6 In the night before Herod was going to lead him before the people, Peter was asleep, bound with two chains between to soldiers, and some guards before the door kept the gaol. 7 But behold! the Lord's angel stood by him, and a light shone in the room. Tapping Peter's body he woke him up, saying: “Rise quickly!” And his chains fell from his hands. 8 The angel said to him: “Put your girt around your hips and tie your shoes on your feet!” He did so. And he said to him: “Put your cloak on your body and follow me!” 9 And he went outside and followed him, but he did now know that what happened [Q: happens] by the angel was [Q: is] true. He supposed that he saw  [Q: is seeing] t a vision. 10 Passing by the first guard, and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, and that opened itself to them. And after they [dual] went outside they walked down one street, and in that moment the angel went away from him.
11 And Peter, finding himself, said: “Now I know that the Lord sent his angel and delivered me from Herod's hand and from everything that the people of the Jews is waiting for.»
	12 After making a consideration he went to the house of Mary, mother of John who had the nickname Mark. In the house a quite large [fárea: sufficient] number of people were assembled, praying. 13 When he knocked on [ana: against] the door, a female slave whose name was Rhoda came to open, 14 and when she recognized Peter's voice, for [-nen] her joy she did not open the gate, but ran inside and told that Peter was standing [Q: is standing] before the door. 15 They said to her: “You are out of your mind!” But she said forcefully [veassenen: with vigour] that so it was [Q: is]. They said: “It is his angel.” 16 But Peter remained where he was, knocking. When they opened, they saw him and were startled. 17 But he made a gesture to them with his hand, for them to be silent, and he told them everything about how the Lord led him out of gaol, and he said: “Tell these things to Jacob and to the brothers.” Then he went outside and went to another place.
18 When morning came, there was no little exitement among the soldiers, about what really had happened to Peter. 19 Herod sought him, and when he did not find him, he commanded that one was to lead the soldiers away for punishment. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and remained there.
	20 He had great wrath against the people of [lit. in] Tyre and Sidon. As one they came to him, and they spoke with Blastus, the chief of the bedchamber of the king, and gained his support. Thereafter they asked for peace, for their land received its food from that of the king. 21 But on a set day Herod covered himself with a royal garment and sat down on the seat of judgement and talked to them. 22 Then the people cried: “A god's voice, and not [that] of a man!” 23 In the same moment the Lord's angel struck him, since he did not give the glory to God. He was eaten by worms and expired.
	24 But the Lord's word grew and spread. 25 Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem after they completed their service, and they brought John, who had the nickname Mark. 
CHAPTER 13
[There] were in Antioch some prophets and teachers [*peantar-li > peantalli] in the congregation that was there, Barnabas and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius from Cyrene, and Manaen who was instructed [or, educated] with Herod the farthing-ruler, and Saul. 2 While they were doing service for the Lord and were fasting, the Holy Spirit said: “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I called them.” 3 Then they kept a fast and prayed and put their hands [dual] upon them [dual] and let them [dual] go.
4 Therefore these men, sent by the Holy Spirit, went down into Seleucia, and from there they [dual] sailed away to Cyprus. 5 And when they [dual] came into Salamis they made God's word known in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John with them [dual], helping them [dual].
	6 When they [plural] went through the entire island as far as Paphos, they met a man who was a wizard, a false prophet [furutercáno: lie-herald]. 7 He was with Sergius Paulus, the governor, who was an intelligent man. After he called Barnabas and Saul to himself, this man sought to hear God's word. 8 But Elymas the wizard – for that is what his name means – stood against them [dual], seeking to turn the governor away from the faith. 9 Saul, who is also Paul [Paulus/Paulo], was filled with Holy Spirit, looked at him 10 and said: “O man full of every kind of lie and of every wicked deed, o son of the Devil, o enemy of all that is just, will you not stop twisting the straight roads of the Lord?
11 And now, behold, the Lord's hand is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sunlight for a time.” In the same moment mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went seeking people to lead him by the hand. 12 Then the governor, when he saw what was happend, believed; and he marveled at [-nen] the Lord's teaching.
	13 The men that were with Paul now went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John abandoned them and returned to Jerusalem. 14 But they [dual], after they went away from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the sabbath and sat down. 15 After the reading out of the Law and of the Prophets, the synagogue chiefs sent to them, saying: “Men, brothers, if you have a word of comfort for the people, tell it!”
	16 And Paul arose, and making a gesture with his hand he said: “Men, Israelites and you who fear God, listen! 17 The God of our people Israel chose our fathers and made our people great while they were dwelling as foreigners in Egypt; then with a mighty arm he led them out from there, 18 and through[out] forty years he gave them food in the wilderness. 19 After he destroyed ten peoples in Canaan, he caused them to possess their land 20 for about four hundred and fifty years. Thereafter he gave them judges, until Samuel the Prophet. 21 Then they requested a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin. After forty years 22 he put him away and raised up David son of Jesse to be king, about whom he also said as a witness: I have found David son of Jesse a man according to my heart, who will do my entire will. 23 From this man's seed, God by his promise sent a Savior to Israel, Jesus, 24 after John, before his coming, made baptism of repentance known to the entire people of Israel. 25 But when John was soon going to complete his run, he said: Who do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, after me comes a person whose shoes [dual] I am not worthy to loosen!
	26 Men, brothers, sons of the kin of Abraham and the people among you that fear God: To you the word of this salvation has been sent. 27 For [those] that dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers did not know this person, but when they judged him they made true the sayings of the Prophets, which are being read aloud on every sabbath, 28 and though they did not find [any] cause of death, they requested from Pilate that one was to kill him. 29 After they completed all the things written about him, they took him down from the tree and put him in a grave. 30 But God raised him out of [the] dead, 31 and through[out] many days he was being seen by those that had gone with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, that are now his witnesses to the people.
32 For we [excl.] make known to you the gospel about the promise given to the fathers: 33 that God has made it real to us [incl.], their children, by resurrecting Jesus, as is also written in the second psalm: You are my son, I begat you today. 34 That he resurrected him out of [the] dead, and that he will not return to a corrupt state, he has said [= expressed] thus: I will give to you David's mercies, the faithful ones. 35 Therefore he also says in another psalm: You will not allow your faithful one to see a corrupt state. 36 For David, after he was a servant to God's will in his own generation, died and as put [or, lain] with his fathers and saw a corrupt state. 37 But [he] whom God raised did not see a corrupt state. 38 Therefore you are to know – men, brothers – that through this man the forgiveness of sins is made known to you. 39 For the guilt from which it was not possible for you to be freed by the Law of Moses – concerning that anyone who believes is said [to be] without guilt [or: is pronounced guiltless]. 
40 Therefore see that [that] which is said in the Prophets will not come upon you: 41 Look, you who speak mockery, and be filled with wonder, for I do a work in your days – a work that you will by no means believe even if anyone tells you about it!”
	42 [When] leaving, the people asked to hear more about these matters on the following day of rest. 43 Therefore, after the people that were assembled scattered, numerous ones among the Jews and the converts that feared God followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to remain in God's grace.
	44 On the following day of rest nearly the entire city assembled to hear the word of the Lord. 45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with envy, and with blasphemy they spoke against the things said by Paul.
46 Then, talking with boldness, Paul and Barnabas said: “To you it was necessary to first speak God's word. Since you push it away and do not count yourselves worthy for eternal life, behold! we turn [Q: turn ourselves] to non-Jews. 47 For so the Lord has commanded us: I have put you like a light of nations, for you to be salvation to the remotest part of earth.” 
	48 When the people of the nations heard that, they had joy and praised God's word, and all that were destined for eternal life believed. 49 Furthermore, the Lord's word was carried through the entire country. 50 But the Jews stirred up the reverent women and the prominent men in the city, and they raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them beyond their borders. 51 They [dual] shook the dust from their feet [dual] and went to Iconium. 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and Holy Spirit.
CHAPTER 14
Now in Iconium they [dual] went together into the synagogue, and they spoke in a manner causing a huge multitude to believe, Jews and Greeks alike. 2 But the Jews that did not believe stirred up the non-Jews and made them hostile against the brothers. 3 And yet, for a long time, they [dual = Paul and Barnabas] spoke with boldness by the power of the Lord, who witnessed to the word of his grace, by allowing signs and portents to happen through their [dual] hands.
	4 But the multitude in the city was split, and some people were for the Jews and some others for the apostles. 5 There was an uprising of non-Jews and the Jews alike, with their rulers, to humiliate them [dual] and to kill them with stones. 6 When they [dual] perceived it, they fled to the cities in Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe and the country surrounding it. 7 And there they [dual] made the gospel known.
	8 And in Lystra [there] was a man sitting who could not stand on his feet. He was lame from his mother's womb and had not ever walked. 9 This man listened to Paul when he talked, and when Paul looked at him and saw that he had the faith to be healed, 10 he spoke to him with a mighty voice: “Stand up on your feet, straight!” And he jumped up and walked. 11 And the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, raised their voices, saying in the tongue of Lycaonia: “The gods have become men and have come down to us!” 12 And they called Barnabas Zeus, but Paul Hermes, since he was [the one] who spoke for them [dual]. 13 And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to sacrifice with the crowds.
	14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about that, they rent their cloaks and jumped into the crowd, crying 15 and saying: “Men, what is your reason for doing these things? Also we [dual] are men that suffer the same things that you suffer, and we [dual] make the gospel known to you, wishing that you will turn yourselves away from these empty things to the living God, who created heaven and earth and sea and all the things in them.
16 In the past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways, though he did not let himself lack witness about his doing good, giving them rain from heaven and fruit in the proper time, filling their heart with food and joy.” 18 And speaking so they [dual] stopped – though with difficulty – the crowds from sacrificing to them [dual].
	19 But [there] came some Jews from Antioch and Iconium and spoke to the crowds and changed their mind, and they threw stones at Paul and drew him out of the city, supposing that he was [Q: is] dead. 20 But when the disciples surrounded him, he arose and went into the city. And on the following day he went away with Barnabas, going to Derbe. 21 And after they made known the gospel to that city and made a quite large [lit. 'sufficient'] number of disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch.
22 They strengthened the souls of the disciples, urging them to remain in the faith by saying: “It is necessary for us to go into God's kingdom through many tribulations.” 23 Furthermore, they [dual] appointed for them elders in every congregation, and by praying and fasting they [dual] gave them into [the] hand of the Lord in whom they [pl.] believed.
	24 And they [dual] went through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia, 25 and after they spoke the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 26 And from there they [dual] sailed away to Antioch, where beforehand God's grace was put in their [dual] care for the work they had now completed.
	27 After they [dual] came there and gathered the congregation, they [dual] told them [plural] about all the things that God had done through them [dual], and that he had [Q: has] opened to the non-Jews the door of faith. 28 Then they [dual] remained for not a short time with the disciples. 
CHAPTER 15
And some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers: “If you are not circumcised, by the tradition [haime, habit] of Moses, it is not possible for you to obtain salvation.” 2 But after no small strife and quarreling among them and Paul and Barnabas, they arranged that Paul and Barnabas and some others from them were going to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this dispute.
	3 Therefore they, sent by the congregation, went through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling how some non-Jews were converted [lit. turned themselves], and they brought great joy to the brothers. 4 When they came to Jerusalem they were received by the congregation and the apostles and the elder men, and they told about all the things that God did by them. 5 And yet some persons from the  order of the Pharisees that believed, arose from their seats and said: “It is necessary to circumcize them and command them to keep the law of Moses.”
	6 And the apostles and the elders assembled to make a consideration about this matter. 7 After much dispute Peter arose and said to them: “Men, brothers, you know that from the first days God's choice was that through my mouth the nations were going to hear the word of the gospel, for them to believe. 8 Thus God, who knows the hearts, witnessed to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, as he also did to us. 9 In nothing did he behave towards us and them in a different manner, after cleansing their heart by faith. 10 Therefore, now what is your reason for testing God, by putting on the neck of these disciples a yoke that it was not possible to us and to our fathers alike to bear? 11 On the contrary, we believe that we will be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, as also these people believe.
	12 And the entire multitude was made silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul when they [dual] told about all the signs and portents that God had done among the nations through them [dual]. 13 After they stopped talking, Jacob said: “Men, brothers listen to me! 14 Symeon has told how God first gave heed to the nations to take out of them a people for his name. 15 And the words of the prophets say the same thing, as is written: 16 'After these things I will return and I will rebuild David's fallen shelter, and I will rebuild its ruinous parts and I will raise it agan, 17 causing [those] that remained among the men to seek the Lord, with people from all the nations,' says the Lord who is doing these things, 18 known from of old. 19 Therefore my judgment is that we are not to cause difficulty to the people from the nations that turn themselves to God, 20 but that we will write to them that it is necessary for them to keep themselves away from idols and fornication and from what is strangled, and from blood. 21 For from ancient times Moses has had in all cities people that make him known, since he is read out in the synagogies on every day of rest.”
	22 Then it seemed well to the apostles and the elders and to the whole congregation to send some chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, prominent men among the brothers, 23 and by their hand they wrote:
	“The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to the brothers that are in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, they that are of the nations: Greetings! [lit. sit in happiness/goodness]. 24 Since we have heard that some people from among us have caused you difficulty with their words, trying to overturn your soul though we have not given them instructions, 25 we have with one mind made the choice that we will send some men to you with our dear ones, Barnabas and Paul, 26 men that have put their life in danger, for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 Therefore we send Judas and Silas, to tell you the same things by word. 28 For it seemed well to the Holy Spirit and to us not to put another burden upon you except these things that are necessary: 29 Keep yourselves away from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from strangled animals, and from fornication. If you keep yourselves away from these things, you will do well. Health to you!”
	30 Thus, when these men were being sent, they went down to Antioch, and they gathered the multitude and gave them the letter. 31 And after they read it, they had joy by the encouragement [hortale: urging]. 32 And Judas and Silas, since also they [dual] were prophets, urged the brothers with many words and strengthened them. 33 After dwelling there for [lit. though] a time, they were released by the brothers back to [those] that sent them. 34 But Silas thought it was good for him to tarry there. 35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they [dual] and numerous others made known the gospel about the Lord's word.
	36 After some days Paul said to Barnabas: “Let us [dual] return and see to the brothers in every city in which we [dual] made known God's word, to see how they are doing.” 27 But Barnabas wished to bring with himself also John, who was called Mark. 38 But Paul did not think it was good to bring the men who abandoned them [dual] in Pamphylia and did not go with them [dual] to the work. 39 The anger between them was so sharp that it caused them to abandon one another, and Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus. 40 Paul chose Silas [as a companion] and went away after the Lord's grace was put in his keeping by the brothers. 41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.
CHAPTER 16
Then he came to Derbe and also to Lystra. And behold! [there] was there a disciple whose name was Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman, but of a Greek father. 2 Of him all the brotehrs in Lystra and Iconium spoke well. 3 Paul wished that he would come with him, and he took and circumsized him, by reason of the Jews that were in those regions, for all knew that his father was Greek. 4 But when they [dual] went through the cities, they commanded them to keep the statutes fixed by the apostles and elders that were in Jerusalem. 5 Thus the congregations were being strengthened in the faith and rose in number from day to day.
	6 Furthermore, they [dual] went through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, since the Holy Spirit forbade to speak the word in Asia, 7 but when they [dual] came to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia, but Jesus' spirit did not allow them [dual].
8 After they [dual] went through Mysia they came down to Troas. 9 And in the night Paul received a vision: A man from Macedonia stood requesting of him, saying: “Come over into Macedonia and help us!” 10 After he saw the vision, we sought to go to Macedonia, supposing that God summoned us to make the gospel known to them.
	11 Therefore we sailed from Troas and went straight to Samothrace, but on the following day to Neapolis 12 and from there to Philippi, a colony [vinyamar: new home], which is the most prominent city in the Macedonia region. We halted in this city, remaining for some days. 13 And on the day of rest we went outside though the gate, to a place beside a river which we thought was a place of prayer, and we sat down and talked to the women that were assembled. 14 And a woman whose name was Lydia, a trader in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira who worshipped God, listened, and the Lord opened her heart to give heed to the things that Paul spoke. 13 After she and his family were baptized, she said in entreaty: “If you judge me faithful to the Lord, come into my house and remain!” And she compelled us to come.
	16 And it came [to pass], when we were going to the place of prayer, that a female slave met us, having a spirit of foresight [/prophecy]. She brought her masters much money by using foresight. 17 This woman followed Paul and us, crying these words: “These men are slaves of God Most High, and they make known to you the path of salvation.” 18 She did so for many days. Weary, Paul finally turned [Q: turned himself] and said to the spirit: “I command you by the name of Jesus Christ: Come out of her!” And it came out in the same hour.
	19 When her masters saw that their hope of gain was [Q: is] gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them [dual] to the place of commerce, to the rulers. 20 They brought them to the judges and said: “These men trouble our city, being Jewish, 21 and they [dual] make known customs that are not allowed for us as Romans to receive or follow.” 22 And the crowed arose against them [dual], and the judges, after the tore their cloaks from them [dual], commanded that one was to [Q: will] beat them with sticks [or, with clubs: rundainen]. 23 After they gave them [dual] many blows, they threw them into gaol, commanding the goalkeeper [mando-cundo] to keep them securely. 24 After they received such command, he threw them into the inmost gaol and fastened the their feet [dual] to the block [pano: beam]. 
	25 But around the midst of the night Paul and Silas were praying, praising God with song, and the people in the gaol listened to them. 26 Suddenly a great earthquake happened, causing the foundations of the gaol to shake. Furthermore, in the same moment all the doors were opened, and the chains of all were loosened.
27 The gaoler, when he was awakened and saw the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword and was going to kill himself, supposing that everyone in the gaol was [Q: is] gone. 28 But Paul cried with a mighty voice: “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!” 29 And he asked for lights and jumped inside, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas. 30 And he led them [dual] outside and said: “Lords, what is necessary for me to do to obtain salvation?” 31 They [dual] said: “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your family.” 32 And they [dual] spoke the Lord's word to him and to all that were in his house. 33 And he brought them with him in that hour and washed their stripes, and he and all that were with him were baptized without waiting. 34 And he brought them into his house and put food on the table before them [dual], and he had great joy with his entire familty, since he had found faith in God.
	35 When day came, the judges sent the club-bearers [or, constables] to say: “Release those men!” 36 And the gaoler told these words to Paul: “The judges have sent some men to release you [dual]! Therefore, now come out and go away in peace!” 37 But Paul said to them: “They flogged us [dual] before the people without judgement, men that are Romans, and they threw us [dual] into gaol – and now they are throwing us out secretly? By no means! Let them come and lead us [dual] outside!” 38 The club-bearers told these words to the judges. They [plural] were scared when they heard that they [dual] were [Q: are] Romans. 39 Therefore they [plural] came and made a petition to them [dual], and after they brought them outside, they [plural] asked that they [dual] would go away from the city. 40 But they [dual] came out from the prison and went to the house of Lydia, and when they [dual] saw the brothers they [dual] urged [/encouraged] them. Then they [dual] went away. 
CHAPTER 17
Now they [dual] went through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where [there] was a Jewish synagogue. 2 Thus, by his habit, Paul went in to them, and on three sabbaths he spoke with them about the Scriptures,3 giving them understanding and showing that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise from [the] dead, and he said: “This is the Christ, this Jesus that I make known to you.” 4 Therefore some people among them believed and stuck to Paul and Silas, with a great multitude of the Greeks that served God, and not a few of the most prominent women.
	5 But the Jews were being filled with envy, and after they gathered some wicked men from the place of commerce and formed a crowd, they caused an uprising in the city. They fell upon the house of Jason and sought to bring them ouside to the people.
6 When they did not find them they drew Jason and some brothers to the rulers of the city, crying: “These people that have turned the world upside down have now come here as well, 7 and Jason has received them into his house! And all these people stand against the commands of the Emperor, for they say that [there] is another king, Jesus.” 8 They stirred up the crowd and the rulers of the city  that heard these things, 9 and after taking sufficient security from Jason and the others they released them.
	10 Without waiting, in that night the brothers sent both Paul and Silas to Beroea, and when they [dual] came there, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. 11 They [pl.] were nobler than those that lived in Thessalonica, and they received the word with all good will, and every day they searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so. 12 Therefore numerous ones among them believed, and so did not a few prominent Greek women, also numerous men.
13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica learnt that God's word was [Q: is] being made known also in Beroea by Paul, they came there stirring up and disturbing the crowds. 14 Without waiting the brothers sent Paul away, as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy alike remained were they [dual] were. 15 But [those] that led Paul brought him as far as Athens, and they returned bringing his command to Silas and Timothy: It was necessary for them [dual] to come as soon as they could [lit. to come with their speed].
	16 While Paul was waiting for them [dual] in Athens, his spirit was being disturned by seeing how the city was full of idols. 17 Therefore he talked in the synagoge with the Jews and the others that worshipped God – also in the place of commerce, with those that came there. 18 But some among the philosophers, the Epicureans and the Stoics alike, went into dispute with him, and some people among them said: “What does this idle-talking person want to say?” Others said: “It seems he is making known some foreign gods.” That was since he talked about the gospel about Jesus and the resurrection.
19 Therefore they took him and led him into the Areopagus, saying: “May we know what it is, this teaching that you are speaking? 20 For you bring some ideas that are strange to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.” 21 For all in Athens and all the foreigners there set aside every free moment to do nothing except tell or hear news.
	22 Paul stood up in the middle of the Areopagus and said: “Men from Athens, I perceive that in all things you have an awe for the gods greater than what others have. 23 For while I was going through the city, looking at the things that you worship, I found also an alter on which it was written: “To an unknown god.” Therefore, [that] which you worship without knowing it, that I am making known to you.
24 The God who made the earth and everything that is in it does not dwell in temples made by hands. 25 Furthermore, he is not being served by men's hands, as if he has [any] need of a single thing, he himself giving to all life and breath and all things. 26 And he made out of one man every nation of men, for them to dwell on the entire surface of [the] earth, and he appointed the times and the borders for the dwelling [vehte, 'haunt'] of men, 27 for them to seek God, if they can reach towards him and find him, though indeed he is not far from a single person among us. 28 For by him we have life and we move and we exist, as also some poets [maitar-li > maitalli] among you have said: 'For we are also his kin.'
	29 Therefore, seeing that we are God's kin, we do not do well if we think about the Deity that he is like gold or silver or stone, or an artifact formed by man's art or thought. 30 True, God showed patience in these times when people have been lacking knowledge, but now he says to men in every place that it is necessary for them to find repentance. 31 For he has set a day in which he will judge earth in righteousness by a man that he has chosen, and he has given to all men security [of this] by raising him out of [the] dead.”
	32 But when they heard about resurrection of [the] dead, some among them spoke mockery, while others said: “We will hear you again about this matter another time.” 33 Thus Paul went out from their midst, 34 but some people stuck to him and believed. Among them were Dionysius who was a judge in the Areopagus, and a woman called Damaris, and some others beside them [dual].
CHAPTER 18
After these things he went away from Athens and came to Corinth. 2 And he found a Jew called Aquila, a man born in Pontus, who a short time ago had come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, since by the command of Claudius all Jews went away from Rome. And he came to them, 3 and since they had the same kind of work, he remained with them and laboured. For their work was to make tents. 4 But he talked in the synagogue every sabbath and caused Jews and Greeks to believe.
	5 When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul completely gave himself to making the Word known, witnessing to the Jews that Jesus was [Q; is] the Christ. 6 But when they stood against him and spoke mockery, he shook the dust from his garments and said to them: “May you blood come upon your own head! I am clean. From now I go to non-Jews.” 7 And he moved from there and went into the house of a person called Titius Justus, who worshipped God. His house was built into the same building where the synagogue was. 8 Crispus the synagogue ruler received the faith in the Lord with his entire family, and after hearing, numerous ones among the people of Corinth believed and were baptized. 9 And in a vision in the night the Lord said to Paul: “Do not fear, but speak and do not be silent, for I am with you and no one will do to you [any] evil, for I have numerous people in this city.” 11 And he remained there for one year and six months, teaching among them God's word.
	12 Now when Gallio was proconsul [nóreturco: nation-chief] of Achaia, the Jews with one mind arose against Paul and led him to the judgement seat, 13 saying: “This man causes men to believe it is necessary for them to worship God in a manner against the Law.” 14 But when Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: “If the matter were about [some] evil or a wicked deed, I had reason to have patience with you. 15 But if the matter is about quarrelings about some words and names and the Law that you have, it is necessary for you to see to it. I do not want to be judge concerning these things.” 16 And he drove them away from the judgement seat. 17 But all among them seized Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him before the judgement seat. But Gallio gave heed to none of these things.
	18 But after remaining there for many days more, Paul said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him went Priscilla and Aquila. He went away after cutting his hair in Cencreai, for he had a pledge. 19 They [pl.] came to Ephesus, and he left them [dual] there, but he went into the synagogue and spoke with the Jews. 20 When they requested from him to stay with them for a longer time, he did not want to, 21 but said farewell and told them: “I will return to you again, if God wishes.” And he sailed away to Ephesus and came down to Caesarea. And he went up and greeted the congregation, and went down to Antioch.
	23 And after he dwelt there for [ter = through] a time he went away and travelled from place to place through the country of Alatia and Phrygia, strengthening the disciples.
	24 Now [there] came to Ephesus a Jew whose name was Apollo, born in Alexandria. He knew [how] to talk well and was mighty in the Scriptures. 25 He was instructed in the Lord's way, and since he was glowing with the spirit, he talked and taught what was true concerning Jesus, be he knew only John's baptism. 26 And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they [dual] took him with them and led him to a deeper understanding of God's way. 27 Furthermore, since he wished to go into Achaia, the brothers wrote to the disciples, urging them to receive him well [lit. urging that they were going to receive him well]. Thus, when he came there, he greatly helped those who believed by the grace. 28 And with vigour he indicated the mistake of the Jews, showing from the scriptures that Jesus was [Q: is] the Christ.  
CHAPTER 19
While Apollos was in Corinth it happened [lit. came] that Paul went through the inlands [lit. inside countries] as far as Ephesus. And he found some disciples 2 and said to them: “Did you receive Holy Spirit when you believed?” They said to him: “Indeed we have not [even] heard that [there] is a Holy Spirit.” 3 And he said: “In what, then, were you baptized?” They answered: “In the baptism of John.” 4 Paul said: “John baptized with the baptism of mind-change, urging the people to believe in [the one] who was going to come after him – that is, in Jesus.” 5 When they heard that, they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. 6 And when Paul put his hands [dual] on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and talked like prophets. 7 Their whole number was around twelve men.
	8 He entered the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, talking and bringing others to an understanding of God's kingdom. 9 But when some people made themselves hard and did not believe, speaking mockery about the Way before the multitude, he abandoned them and separated the disciples from them, on every day giving talks in the hall of Tyranus.10 That happened throughout two years, and thus all that dwelt in Asia heard God's word, Jews and Greeks alike.
	11 God did some mighty deeds, beyond what was usual, by Paul's hands. 12 Thus even clothes and aprons were carried from his skin and put on the sick ones, and the illnesses went away from them, and the wicked spirits came out. 13 But [there] were also some wandering Jews among those that threw out demons who tried to speak Jesus' name against [those] who were possessed by demons: “I command you by the Jesus whom Paul makes known.” 14 [There] were seven sons of a man called Sceva, a Jewish high priest, that did so. 15 But in answer the wicked spirit said to them: “Jesus I know, and I have heard about Paul, but who are you?” 16 And the man possessed by the wicked spirit fell upon them and conquered them all, causing them to run wounded and naked out of that house.
17 This matter came to the knowledge of all, of Jews and of Greeks alike, those who dwelt in Ephesus. And fear fell upon all among them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being praised. 18 And numerous ones of [those] who believed came and spoke openly about their deeds. 19 Not a few among those that before used magic gathered their books and burned them before the eyes [dual] of all. And they calculated the sum that they paid for them and found that their value was fifty thousand silver-pieces. 20 Thus, with power, the Lord's word grew and was made mighty.
	21 After these things were finisehd, Paul made [it] his goal that after he went through Macedonia and Achaia he was gong to travel to Jerusalem, saying: “After I shall come there it is also necessary for me to see Rome.” 22 He sent to Macedonia two of his servants, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself remained for a time in Asia. 
	 23 Around that time [there] was not a small uprising concerning the Way. 24 For a man called Demetrius, a silversmith, gave no small wealth to the craftsmen by making silver shrines of Artemis. 25 And he gathered them and [those] who worked with such things and said: “Men, you know well that by this our work we have our wealth. 26 And you see and you hear how not only in Ephesus, but in nearly all Asia, this Paul has brought a big crowd to a new belief, by saying that those gods that are made by hands are not gods at all. 27 Furthermore, [there] is a danger that not only this our work will be despised, but also that the temple of the great Artemis will be counted as nothing, putting an end also to her greatness, before which all Asia and [the] world bow.” 28 Hearing this and being filled with anger, the men cried: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
	29 Thus the city was being filled with confusion, and with one mind they went rushing into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus and bringing them [dual] with them [plural] by force. They [dual] were people from Macedonia traveling with Paul. 30 Paul himself wanted to go inside to the people, but the disciples were not willling to let him. 31 Some among the rulers of Asia, that were his friends, sent to him and asked of him not to put himself in danger in the theater. 32 Some cried one thing and others another thing, and the greater number [i amarimbar, the most numerous ones] did not know the reason by which they were assembled. 33 Therefore they together brought forward Alexander out of the crowd, for the Jews pushed him forward. 34 But when they understood that he was a Jew, they cried with one voice for [ter, through] around two hours: “Great is Artemis of [the] Ephesians!”
	35 After the city scribe made the crowd quiet, he said: “Men, who is [there] among men who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image that fell from heaven? 36 Therefore, since one cannot deny that, you will do well if you are still and do nothing without thought. 37 For you have brought these men that are not robbers of temples and have not spoken mockery against our goddess. 38 Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a dispute with anyone, [there] are court days [lit. days of judgement] and [there] are proconsuls [nóreturcor, land-chiefs]: Let them bring the disputes that they have, one with the other, to the judges. 39 But if you seek more beyond that, it is necessary that a regular assembly settles [tulca, establishes] it. 40 For [there] is danger that complaints about uprising will be brought against us after what has happened today, for we do not have a single reason to give concerning this clamour.” 41 And after he said that, he sent the ones having assembled away.
CHAPTER 20
When the uprising was over, Paul summoned the disciples, and after he encouraged them and said farewell to them, he went away to go into Macedonia. 2 After he went through those regions and encouraged [those] that were there with numerous words, he came into Greece. 3 And after he remained three months there, he was going to said away to Syrian, but since the Jews made plans against him, he made the choice that he was going to return through Macedonia. 4 With him on the journey were Sosipather the son of Pyrrhus from Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, and Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy and Tryphimus from Asia. 5 They went before us and waited for us in Troas, but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Breads, and we came to them in Troas before five days were gone. There we remained for seven days.
	7 On the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread, Paul talked to them, since he was going away on the following day, and he was speaking until the middle of the night. 8 But [there] were many lamps in the upper hall where we were assembled. 9 Sitting by the window was a young man called Eutychus, who fell into deep sleep while Paul was talking, and collapsing in sleep he fell down from the third floor and was dead when he was lifted up. 10 But Paul went down, threw himself upon him, put his arms around him and said: “Do not make clamour, for he is still alive.” 11 Then he returned up, broke the bread and ate, and he talped until dawn and then went away. 12 But the boy they brough away alive, and they were comforted beyond measure.
	13 Now we went before them to the boat and sailed away to Assos, where we were going to receive Paul into the ship. For after he gave commands about that, he himself wished to go on his feet [= by foot]. 14 When he came as far as the place where we were in Assos, we received him into the boat and went to Mitylene. 15 And after we sailed from there on the following day we came beside Chios, and after one more day we reached as far as Samos, and on the following day we came into Miletus. 16 For Paul made the choice that he would pass over Ephesus, not wishing to halt in Asia, for he was traveling in urgency: If he could he wanted to reach Jerusalem before the Festival of Seven Weeks [= Pentecost].
	17 But from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the congregation. 18 When they came to him he said to them: “You know well how from the first day that I came to Asia I was with you the whole time, 19 working for the Lord in all lowliness, having tears and suffering the tribulations that happened to me by the evil plans of the Jews, 20 while I did not keep from you a single thing beneficial to you, or failed to instruct you before the people and in the houses.
21 But I witnessed to Jews and to Greeks alike about repentance towards God and faith in our Lord, Jesus. 22 And now, behold, bound in the spirit I go to Jerusalem, though I do not know [the things] that will happen to me in it, 23 except that in every city the Holy Spirit witnesses to me that bonds and tribulations are waiting for me. 24 And yet I do not count my life that dear to me, if it is possible for me to complete my ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus: Witnessing about the gospel of the grace of God.
	25 And now, behold, I know that you will not see my face again, you all among whom I walked, making known the kingdom  26 Therefore I witness to all among you that I am clean from the blood of all men, 27 for I have not kept myself from telling you God's entire plan. 
	28 Watch yourselves and the entire flock which the Holy Spirit has put in your patronage [/care, protection, overseership]. Be shepherds for the Lord's congregation, which he gained with his own blood. 29 I know that after I pass, oppressive wolves will come among you, that do not have mercy on the flock, 30 and from yourselves [there] will arise some men that speak twisted things, to draw away the disicples after themselves. 31 Therefore be awake, recalling how through[out] three years, at night and at day, I did not stop instructing you with tears. 32 And now I give you over to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you your part as heirs, with all the sanctified ones. 33 Silver or gold or garment I have not sought from anyone. 34 You yourselves know that these hands have given me and [those] who were with me our needs. 35 I always showed you that when you so work it is necessary for you to help [those] that are weak and to recall the word with the Lord Jesus himself spoke: Giving is a joy greater than receiving.
26 And after he spoke these words, he fell upon his knees [dual] with all among them and prayed. 27 [There] was quite a lot of [lit. sufficient] wailing among them all, and they fell upon Paul's neck and kissed him. 28 For above everything they were being tormented by the word that he said, that they were not going to see his face again. Then they followed him to the boat.
CHAPTER 21
After we compelled ourselves to leave them and sailed away, we went straight to Cos, but on the following day to Rhodos, and from there to Patara. 2 And after he found a boat that was to go to Phoenicia, we went aboard [lit. into it] and sailed away. 3 After we saw Cyprus, we went past it on the left, sailed to Syria and came to Tyre, for that was the destination [enne: goal] of the goods on the boat. 
4 We sought the disciples and found them, and we remained there for [ter 'through'] seven days. But by the Spirit they said to Paul: “Do not set foot in Jerusalem!” 5 But when the days were past, we went forth and went on our way. All among them, with the women and children, followed us as far as the outside of the city. And after falling to our knees on the beach we prayed, 6 and we said farewell to one another, and we went into the boat, but they returned home.
	7 From Tyre we came to Ptolemais, completing the voyage [luntelenda: boat-journey]. We greeted the brothers and remained one day with them. 8 On the following day we sailed away and came to Caesarea, and we went into the house of Philip, a man who was making known the gospel. He was among the Seven, and we remained with him. 9 [There] were with this man four daughters, virgins, who had a prophet's gift. 
10 But while we remained there for [ter 'through'] a number of days, a prophet whose name was Agabus came down from Judea, and he came to us and took the belt of Paul. He bound his own feet and hands and said: “Thus says the Holy Spirit: The man who owns this belt the Jews in Jerusalem will bind, and they will give him over to non-Jews.” 12 When we heard this, we and [those] who dwelt there alike asked of him: “Do not go up to Jerusalem!” 13 Then Paul answered: “What are you doing, wailing and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not just to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” 14 When it was not possible for us to change his mind, we stopped asking and said: “Let the Lord's will happen.”
	15 After these days we prepared and went on our journey to Jerusalem. 16 But some of the discipes from Jerusalem also went with us, to bring us to the man in whose house we were going to dwell: Mnason, who was of the first disciples.
	17 When we came to Jerusalem, the brothers received us in [or, with] joy. 18 But on the following day Paul went with us into the house of James, and all the elders were there. 19 And they greeted them and told about every single thing that God did among the nations by his ministry.
	20 After hearing that they gave glory to God, and they said to him: “You behold, brother, how [there] are multitudes that believe among the Jews, and all among them burn for the Law. 21 But they have heard that it has been said concerning you that you have taught among the nations that it is necessary for them to stand away from Moses, teaching them that they are not to circumcise their children or follow the customs. 22 What, then, are we to do? It is certain that they will hear that you have come.
23 Therefore do this thing that we tell you: [There] are with us four men that have a vow. 24 Bring them with you and purify yourself with them, and you pay for them, for them to cut the hair off their head. Then all will understand that what they have heard about you is not true, but that you follow the Law and keep it. 25 Concerning the non-Jews that believe we have written to them, commanding that it is necessary for them to keep themselves away from what has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from flesh of strangled animals and from fornication.”
	26 Then Paul brought the men with him, and on the following day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, to make known the date when their purification was going to be completed and the sacrifice was going to be brought for each one among them.
	27 But shortly before the seven days were complete, the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple and caused an uprising among the crowd, and they put their hands on him 28 and cried: “Men of Israel, help! This man is [the one] who teaches everyone in every place against the people and the Law, and against this [holy] place! Furthermore, he has brought some Greeks into the temple, defiling this holy place!” 29 For before they saw Tryphimus from Ephesus in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul brought him into the temple. 30 And the whole city was stirred, and the people ran together, and they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. In the same moment the gates were closed. 31 And while they sought to kill him, word came to the chief of the army, about all of Jerusalem being in disorder. 32 Without waiting he brought some soldiers [ohtar-li > ohtalli] and centurions [tuxantur-li > tuxantulli] and ran down to them. Seeing the chief and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul. 
33 Then the army commander came and took him and commanded: “Bind him with two chains!” And he asked about who he was and about what he had done. 34 But some in the crowd cried one thing and others another thing. By reason of the noise he could learn nothing certain, and he commanded that they were to bring Paul to the [army] camp. 35 But when he came to the steps [= the stairs] it was necessary for the soldiers to carry him, because of the violence of the crowd. 36 For the multitude of the people followed him, crying: “Kill him!”
	37 When they were going to lead him into the camp, Paul said to the army commander: “May I say something to you?” He said: “Can you speak Greek? 38 Are you really not the Egyptian who before these days caused an unrising and led the four thousand dagger men into the wilderness?” 39 Then Paul said: “I [am] a Jewish man, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, a city not obscure. But I ask of you: Allow me to speak to the people!”
40 After he allowed that, Paul, standing on the steps, moved with his hand to the people. When a deep silence fell, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:
CHAPTER 22
“Men, brothers and fathers, hear me speak for myself!” 2 When they heard that he was speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they were still more silent, and he said: 3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but instructed [or, educated] in this city before the feet of Gamaliel in the tough manner of the Law of our fathers. I was burning for God like all among you [are] on this day. 4 And I went pursuing this Way to the death, binding and giving over into prison men and women alike, 5 as also the chief priest and the entire council of elders can witness for me. From them I also got messages to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring also [those] that were there bound to Jerusalem for punishment.
	6 But on my journey, when I came near to Damascus, around the middle of the day, suddenly out of heaven a great line shone at me, 7 and I fell to earth and heard a voice say to me: 'Saul, Saul, what is your reason for persecuting me?' 8 I answered: 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me: 'I am Jesus from Nazareth, whom you pursue.' 9 The men that were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of [the one] who was speaking to me. 10 Then I said: 'What am I to do, Lord?' The Lord said to me: 'Rise, go into Damascus, and there everything which is appointed to you to do will be told you.' 11 But I could not see, because of the glory of that light, and being led by the hand by [those] that were with me I came into Damascus.
12 But a man called Ananias, who was reverent according to [or 'by', -nen] the Law and had a good witness from all the Jews that dwelt there, 13 came to me, and standing by me he said to me: “Saul, brother, see again!” And in the same hour I could again see, seeing him. 14 He said: 'The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Just One and to hear the voice of his mouth, 15 for you will be a witness to him to all men, about the things that you have seen and have heard. 16 And now, how is it that you are waiting? Rise, be baptized and wash your sins away by calling on [or 'by', -nen] his name.
	17 But after I returned to Jerusalem and prayed in the temple, I received a vision 18 and saw him say to me: 'Be quick and go away from Jerusalem with urgency, for they will not receive your witness about me.' 19 And I said: 'Lord, they know well that I threw into gaol and flogged in every synagogue [those] that believe in you, 20 and while the blood of Stephen your witness was being poured forth, I as well was standing near and thought well about what happened, and I was watching the cloaks of the people that killed him.' 21 And yet he said to me: 'Go, for I will send you to far-off nations!'
27 Therefore the army commander came to him and asked: “Tell me, are you Roman?” He said: “I am.” 28 The army commander answered: “I traded to myself those rights [lertier, freedoms] with a great sum [of money].” Paul said: “But I was born into them.”
	29 Therefore, in the same moment, the men that were going to examine him by torture stood away from him, and fear seized the army commander when he found that he was Roman, after he had bound him.
	30 On the following day he wished to know certainly what evil the Jews said that he had [Q: has] done. Therefore he released him from the chains and commanded the High Council that they were to assemble. Then he brought Paul and put him before them.
23 Paul, looking at the High Council, said: “Men, brothers, I have behaved before God with perfect conscience, until this day.”
	2 Then Ananias the chief priest commanded [those] that stood by him that they were to strike him on the mouth. 3 Then Paul said to him: “God will strike you, O whitened wall! Are you sitting to judge me by the Law, and at the same time you are breaking the Law by commanding that I shall be beaten?” 4 [Those] that stood by him said: “Are you speaking evil about the chief priest of God?” 5 And Paul said: “Brothers, I did not know that he is the chief priest. For [it] is written: Do not speak evil of a chief of your people.”
	6 He knew that among [those] that were there, one part was of [the] Sadducees and another of [the] Pharisees, and therefore he cried in the High Council: “Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and the resurrection of [the] dead I am being judged!” 7 Since he said this thing, there was a dispute between Pharisees and Sadducees, and the multitude was split. 8 For Sadducces say that [there] is not [any] resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees openly believe all these things.
	9 Then there was great clamour, and some scribes that were of the party [ranta, 'part'] of the Pharisees arose and said in dispute: “We do not find [any] evil in this man. What if a spirit has indeed spoken to him, or an angel?” 10 When a sharp strife arose, the army commander feared [Q: feared from] that they were going to pull him into pieces, and he commanded the soldiers that they were to go down to snatch him out of their midst and to bring him into the camp.
	11 But on the following day the Lord stood by him and said: “Courage! For as you have witnessed about [the things] that concern me in Jerusalem, so it is necessary for you to witness also in Rome.” 12 When day came, the Jews made a compact and cursed themselves if they ate or drank before killing Paul. 13 The number of the men who together gave this oath was over forty. 14 They went to the chief priests and to the elders and said: “We have given an oath that we are not going to eat before we have killed Paul. 15 Therefore tell the army chief, you together with the High Council, that it is necessary for him to bring him down to you, as if you wish to make an inquiry to know more certainly the things that concern him. But before he shall come near, we shall be ready to kill him.”
	16 But when Paul's sister's son heard that they were lying hidden to kill him, he went to him, and when he came to the camp he told it to him. 17 Therefore Paul called one among the centurions and said: 'Bring this young man to the army chief, for he has a thing to tell him.” 18 Therefore this man took him and brought him to the army chief, and he said: “Paul, the bound man, called me and asked of me that I would bring this young man to you, for he has a thing to say to you.” 19 The army chief took his hand and went away to a private place and asked: “What do you have to tell me?”
	20 He said: “The Jews together have made a plan that they will ask that tomorrow you will bring Paul down to the High Council, as if they want to learn more certainly what he has done. 21 But you do not [imperative] allow them to induce you into doing that, for more than forty men among them are lying hidden waiting for him, and they have bound themselves with an oath that they will not eat or drink before they have killed him, and now they are ready, waiting for your assent.” 22 Then the army chief went away from the young man after commanding him: “Do not say to anyone that you have revealed these things to me.”
	23 And he called two of the centurions and said: “Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred men that carry spears, at the third hour of the night. 24 Furthermore, bring some horses. Thus, letting Paul ride, they will bring him in safety to Felix the governor.” 
25 And he wrote a message having these words: 26 “Claudius Lysias to the mighty governor, Felix: Greetings! [lit. sit in happiness!] 27 This man was seized by the Jews and was near to being slain by them, but I fell upon them with the soldiers and saved him, since I learnt that he was [Q: is]
 a Roman. 28 And wishing to know the reason of their complaint against him, I brought him down into their High Council. 29 I found that complaints about disputes touching on their Law are brought against him, but about nothing worthy of death or of chains. 30 But since a plan against this man has been revealed to me, I sent him to you without waiting, and I command [those] that have complaints about him that they must speak against him before you.”
	31 Therefore these soldiers took Paul, as was commanded to them, and brought him at night to Antipatris. 32 On the following day they let the horsemen go with him still, and returned to the camp.
33 The horsemen went into Caesarea and gave the message to the governor, and put also Paul before him. 34 After he read the letter he asked about what region he came from, and learnt that he was from Cilicia. 35 He said: “I will hear you, when the people that have complaints about you shall arive also.” And he commanded that one was to keep him in gaol in the palace [túrion] of Herod. 
CHAPTER 24
After five days Ananias the chief priest came down with some elders and an orator whose name was Tertulllus, and they spoke evil about Paul. 2 When he was called, Tertullus began to speak against him, saying: 
	“Great peace we have through you, and reforms [or 'renewals'] occur in this nation by your foresight! 3 In all times and places, mighty Felix, we receive those with greatest thanks. 4 But so as not to take more of your time, I ask of you that you will listen to us briefly, gracious as you are. 5 For we have found that this man is a pestilence, causing uprisings among all the Jews through[out] the entire world, and he is prominent in the sect [heren, 'order'] of the Nazarenes, 6 a person who also tried to defile the temple, and whom we seized. We wanted to judge him by our Law, 7 but Lysias the army chief came and took him out of our hands [dual] by violence and brought him away. 8 From him it is possible for you, by examining him, to learn about all the crimes that we say he has done.”
	9 The Jews were his supporters and said that so it was. 10 And Paul, when the governor with a gesture of his head allowed him to talk, answered:
	“Knowing well that this nation has had you as judge for [ter = through] many years, I am speaking freely for myself. 11 It is possible for you to learn that only twelve days ago I went up to give worship in Jerusalem. 12 They did not find me in the temple having a dispute with anyone or causing an uprising, in the synagogues or in the city.
13 Furthermore, it is not possible for them to demonstrate that I have done [/committed] the crimes of which they now speak against me. 14 But this thing I openly tell you: By the Way that they call a 'sect', by it I serve God, believing all the matters that are of the Law and written in the Prophets. 15 And I have hope to God, the same hope that also these men have: [There] will be a resurrection of just ones and injust ones alike. 16 Therefore my goal is that I will always have a clean conscience towards God and men. 17 After some years passed, I came to bring gifts of mercy to my nation, and to sacrifice. 18 While I was doing these things, they found me cleansed in the temple, but [there] was not [any] crowd or uprising. But [there] were there some Jews from Asia, 19 and [it] was better if they came before you to speak about my crimes, if they have a complaint against me. 20 Or let these men say what evil they found in me when I stood before the High Council, 21 if it was not this single saying that I cried when I stood before them: 'Concerning the resurrection of [the]dead I am being judged before you today!'
	29 But Felix, knowing well the matters that concerned the Way, turned the men away and said: “When Lysias the army chief shall come down, I will make my choices about the matters that concern you.” 23 And he commanded the centurion to keep the man in a gentle manner, and he was not going to stop anyone among his own from serving him.
	24 After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was Jewish, and he brought Paul and listened to him about the faith in Christ Jesus. 25 But when he talked about justice and self-control and the coming judgement, Felix was scared and answered: “For this time go away, but when I have an opportunity, I will summon you again.” 26 But at the same time he had the hope that he would receive money from Paul. Therefore he summoned him that more frequently, and he talked with him.
	27 But after two years passed, Felix was followed as governor by Porcius Festus, and since Felix wanted to have the grace of the Jews, he left Paul bound.
CHAPTER 25 
Therefore Festus, when he received the power over the region [/province], after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea, 2 and the chief priests and the prominent ones of the Jews told him their complaints against Paul. Then they asked Festus, 2 seeking a favor [lis: grace] against Paul, that he would [Q: will] send him to Jerusalem. For they were going to lie hidden, to kill him on the road. 4 But Festus answered that Paul was going to remain kept in Caesarea, and that he himself would [Q; will] return there soon. 5 He said: “Therefore may the mighty among you come down to speak of his crimes, if there is anything irregular about him.”
	6 Thus, after remaining with them for [ter, through] no more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and the following day he sat down on the judgement seat and commanded that one was to [Q: will] bring Paul. 7 When he came, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, saying that he had [Q: has] done numerous and weighty crimes, but it was not possible for them to show that that was true.
	8 But Paul said, defending himself: “Against the Law or against the Jews or against the High King alike I have not done [/committed] a single sin.” 9 Festus, who wanted to receive the good will of the Jews, answered Paul: “Do you want to go up to Jerusalem to be judged there before me concerning these matters?” 10 But Paul said: “I am standing before the judgement seat of the High King, where it is necessary for me to be judged. I have done nothing evil against the Jews, as also you well know. 11 If I have indeed done a crime and I am worthy of death, I do not ask to escape from death, but if I have not done a single one of the crimes which they say I have done, nobody may give me into their hand. I put my case [natto, matter] before the High King.”
12 After speaking with the council, Festus answered: “Before the High King you have put your case; to the High King you will go.”
	13 After some days passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus. 14 After they were there for [ter, through] a number of days, Festus told the king about the matters that concerned Paul, saying:
	“[There] is a man left bound by Felix, 15 and when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews told me about him, requesting that I would [Q: will] judge him as having guilt. 16 But I answered them that among Romans it is not custom to give anyone over, before the person of whom others say that he had committed crimes meets those that speak against him face to face, and he has the opportunity to speak for himself concerning the complaint.
17 Therefore, when they assembled here, without halting I sat down on the judgement seat and commanded that one was to [Q: one will] bring the man. 18 Standing before me, those who say that he has committed crimes did not talk about the wicked things that I supposed concerning him. 19 They had some quarrels with him about their own worship of the deity, and about a person called Jesus, who is dead, but who Paul said is alive. 20 Not knowing what I was going to do about the quarrel about these things, I asked if he wanted to go to Jerusalem, there to be judged concerning these matters. 21 But when Paul asked to be kept for the judgment of His Majesty, I commanded that he is to be kept until I shall send him to the High King.”
	22 Then Agrippa said to Festus: “I as well wish to hear the man.” He answered: “Tomorrow you will hear him.” 
	23 Therefore, on the following day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great glory and went into the audience chamber [şambe veliéva = room of meeting] with army chiefs and some prominent men from the city, and when Festus commanded, Paul was brought. 24 And Festus said: “King Agrippa and you that are with us, you behold this man concerning whom the entire multitude of Jews together have made pention to me, in Jerusalemn and here alike, crying that he is not worthy of living anymore. 25 But I perceived that he has done nothing worthy of death. Therefore, when this man put his case before his Majesty, I judged that I would [Q: will] send him. 26 But concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Therefore I brought him out before you, and above all before you, King Agrippa: After the interrogation I will know what I am to write. 27 For it seems to me senseless to send a bound person but fail to indicate the complaints against him.
CHAPTER 26 
Agrippa said to Paul: “You may speak.” Then Paul reached out with his hand and spoke, defending himself:
	2 “Concerning all the crimes that the Jews say that I have done, King Agrippa, I count myself happy that [it is] before you I speak for myself today, 3 above all for the reason that you know all the customs and strifes of among Jews. Therefore I ask that you will hear me with patience.
	4 My manner of living from my youth – how I behaved from the beginning in my nation and in Jerusalem – is known by all Jews 5 that have known me beforehand, if they want to witness. They know that my life as a Pharisee was by the harshest order of our worship. 6 And yet now, by reason of the promise given to our fathers, I am standing here to be judged. 7 Our twelve tribes have the hope that they will see the promise made true if they serve him with vigour through night and day. Concerning this hope the Jews say that I have committed crimes, o King.
	8 What is your reason for judging that one cannot believe that God rises [the] dead? 9 I indeed thought that it was necessary for me to stand against the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth in numerous manners, 10 as I also did in Jerusalem, and numerous ones among the holy ones I put in goals after I received power from the chief priests, and when one spoke about killing them, I gave my vote [lit. voice] againat them. 11 Furthermore, I frequently punished them in all synagogues and compelled them to blaspheme, and being extremely angry against them I also pursued them into foreign cities. 
	12 While I was doing these things – on a journey to Damascus, after receiving power and permission from the chief priests – 13 in the midst of the day, still on the road, I saw a light beyond the glory of the sun which shone around me and around [those] who travelled with me. 14 And after all among us fell to the ground I heard a voice say to me in the Hebrew language: 'Saul, Saul, what is your reason for pursuing me? Striking against the spikes will be painful for you.' 15 But I said: 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said: 'I [am] Jesus, whom you pursue. 16 And yet rise and stand on your feet [dual]. For for this purpose I have shown myself to you, to choose you as a servant and a witness both of [the things] that you have seen and of [the things] that I shall cause you to see, concerning me. 17 I deliver you out of this people and from the nations, to which I send you 18 to open their eyes [dual], in order to turn them from darkness to light and from Satan's power to God, for them to receive forgiveness of sins and a part as heirs among [those] who are hallowed by believing in me.'  
	19 Therfore, king Agrippa, I did not fail to heed the vision from heaven, 20 but firstly to [those] that are in Damascus and then to [those] that are in Jerusalem and the entire land surrounding Judea I brought the message that it is necessary for them to find repentance and turn themselves to God, by doing deeds worthy of repentance.
	21 Concerning these things some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. 22 But since I was being helped by God I have stood witnessing to small and to great, but saying nothing except [the things] that the Prophets and Moses alike said were going to happen: 23 The Christ was going to suffer, and as the first being raised from [the] dead, he was going to make light known to this people and to the nations alike.»
	24 When he said these things defending himself, Festus said in a mighty voice: “You are out of your mind, Paul! Great learning is undoing your mind!” 25 But Paul said: “I am not out of my mind, mighty Festus, but I speak sayings of truth and soundness of mind. 26 For the king understands these things, he to whom I am speaking with boldness, for I am certain that nothing of this escapes his notice, for this thing has not been done in a corner.
27 Do you, King Agrippa, believe in the Prophets? I know that you believe.” 28 But Agrippa said to Paul: “In a short time you would talk me into becoming a Christian.” 29 Then Paul said: “I can wish to God that soon or later, not just you but also all that are hearing me today will become such as I am, though without these chains.” 30 But the king arose, and so did the the governor and Bernice and the men that had sat with them. 31 But when they went away they talked one with the other, saying: “This man does nothing worthy of death or of chains.” 32 Furthermore, Agrippa said to Festus: “It was possible to release this man if he did [/had] not put his case before the High King.”
CHAPTER 27
After the choice [or, decision] was made that we were going to sail to Italy [Italia], they gave Paul and some other bound men over to a centurion called Julius, of the army of His Majesty. 2 We went into a ship from Adramyttium which was going to sail from the coast of Asia. We sailed away, and with us was Aristarchus the Macedonian, from Thessalonica. 3 And on the following day we reached Sidon [Q: to Sidon], and Julius showed kindness [lisse: grace] to Paul and allowed him to go to his friends and receive their comfort.
	4 And we sailed away from there and went under the shelter of Cyprus, since the winds were against us. 5 And after we sailed through the open sea [eare] by Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to port in Myra in Lycia. 6 But the centurion found a ship from Alexandria that was going to sail to Italy, and he commanded us to go into that. 7 After sailing slowly for a sufficient number of days and coming to Cnidus with difficulty, since we had the wind in our face, we sailed under the shelter of Crete at Salmone, 8 and sailing difficultly by the shore we came to a place called Fair Havens, near to the city [of] Lasea.
	9 A long time was gone, and now [there] was danger in traveling on sea, for even the Fast was past. Therefore Paul spoke about what he thought was the best, 10 saying to them: “Men, I perceive that sailing will bring destruction, and much will be lost to you, not concerning the goods and the ship alone, but also concerning our lives.” 11 But the centurion heeded the captain and the man who owned the ship more than the things that Paul said. 12 The haven was not good for remaining through the winter, and therefore the greater number [amarimbar = most numerous] thought that it was better to sail away from there, if in this or that manner it was possible for them to reach as far as Phoenix and remain there through the winter. That is a haven of Crete that is open towards the north-east and south-east.
	13 Furthermore, when the wind from the south blew they thought that their goal was in their reach, and they pulled up the anchor and sailed along the coast of Crete. 14 But after not a long time a stormwind, that which is called Euroaquilo, came rushing from the island. 15 The ship was seized and could not keep its prow against the wind, and we stopped trying to control it and were carried [along]. 16 When we came into the shelter of a small island called Cauda, we could with difficulty save the boat [= the skiff, the lifeboat]. 17 After we lifted it into the ship we used the emergency equipment [maure-sorastar] and bound around the ship with ropes. Our fear was that the ship was going to hit the hidden rocks in Syrte; therefore they took down the front sail and were carried [along]. 18 But the storm lay extremely heavy upon us, and on the following day they threw the goods [= the cargo] into the sea, 19 and on the third day with their own hands they threw the equipment of the ship into the sea.
	20 When we did not see the Sun or stars for many [24-hour] days, and no small storm lay upon us, all hope of our salvation faded. 21 And after a long time when they did not eat food, Paul arose among them and said: “Men, you did better if you [had] listened to me, not going away from Crete, but escaping this destruction and loss. 22 But now I exhort you: Have courage, for [there] is not a single person among you who will be lost! Only the ship will be. 23 For in this night [there] stood beforeme an angel of the God whose servant I am, and whom I worship. 24 He said: 'Do not fear, Paul! It is necessary for you to stand before the High King, and behold! God has given you all that are sailing with you.' 24 Therefore have courage, men, for I believe what God said [lit. God's saying], that the matter will be just as has been told me. 26 But we will be thrown onto the beach of some [lit. one] island.”
	27 When the fourteenth night fell and we were thrown hither and thirther on the Sea of Adria, in the middle of the night the sailors supposed that they were [Q: are] coming near to some [lit. one] land. 28 And they measured how deep the sea was and found that it was twenty fathoms. They went a short way forward and measured again, and they found fifteen fathoms. 29 And since we feared that perhaps we were going to strike the rocks, they threw into the sea four anchors from the rear of the ship and longed for the coming of day. 30 But the sailors, seeking to escape from the ship, put the boat on the sea, saying that they were going to hang [Q: will hang] anchors from the prow. 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: “If these men do not remain on the ship, it is not possible for you to be saved!” 32 Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat and let it float way.
	33 When day was near, Paul encouraged all that they were to eat, saying: “Today is the fourteenth day when you are waiting without food, for you have eaten nothing. 34 Therefore I ask of you that you will eat food, for that will help your rescue. For a single hair on the head of anyone among you will not be lost.”
35 After saying these words he took a bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke it and began to eat. 36 Then they had joy, and they as well ate food. 37 Our total number on the ship was two hundred and seventy-six. 38 After eating the food that we wanted, we made the ship less heavy by throwing the grain into the sea.
	39 When day came, they did not know the land, but they saw a bay where [there] was a beach, and they wanted to bring the ship thither, if it was possible for them. 40 Therefore they cut away the anchors and let them fall into the sea, and at the same time they loosened the lashes of the rudder. Then they raised the forward sail towards the wind and went against the beach.
41 When they fell upon a place where the sea struck from both directions, they brought the ship onto ground. The prow was fixed and could not move, but the back of the ship was broken into pieces by the violence of the sea. 42 Then the soldiers wanted to kill the bound men, to stop anyone from escaping by swimming away. 43 But the centurion wished to bring Paul to safety and stopped them from doing what they wanted. And he commanded those that knew [how] to swim that they were to jump into the sea, in order to reach to land first. 44 The others followed, some on planks, some on things from the ship. And thus all were brought safely to land.
CHAPTER 28
After we reached safety we learnt that the name of the island was Melite [= Malta?]. 2 And the people there, who spoke a language that we did not understand, behaved towards us with kindness [lisse = grace, sweetness] beyond what is usual, for they kindled a fire and received us all, by reason of the rain that fell, and of the cold.
	3 But when Paul collected a bunch of sticks and put them on the fire, a snake came out because of the heat and fastened itself to his hand. 4 When the people there saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to the other: “Surely this man is a murderer, and although he was saved from the sea, doom did not allow him to live.” 5 But he shook the venomous creature into the fire and suffered nothing bad. 6 But they thought that he was going to swell, or that suddenly he was going to fall dead. After waiting long and seeing nothing bad happening to him, they changed their mind and said that he was [Q: is] a god.
	7 Near to that place the most prominent man of the island, called Poplio [Publius], had some fields. He received us well and kindly allowed us to dwell in his house for [ter = through] three days. 8 But Poplio's father was bed-ridden with fever [úre: heat] and dystentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, put his hands on him and healed him.
9 After that happened, the other people on the island that had illnesses also came to him and were healed. 10 Thereafter they also glorified us with numerous gifts, and when we sailed away, they gave us things for our needs.
	11 After three months we sailed away on a ship that came from Alexandria. It had remained through the winter on the island, and it had the Twins as the figurehead [lango-emma: prow-image]. 12 We came to Syracus and remained there for [ter = through] three days. 13 From there we went aroud the coast and came to Rhegium, and after one day [there] was a wind from the south, and we arrived in Puteoli on the second day. 14 There we found brothers who requested that we would stay with them for seven days, and thus we came into Rome. 15 And from there the brothers, when they heard the news about us, came to see us as far as Forum Appii and the Three Taverns. Paul, seeing them, gave thanks to God and had courage.
16 When we came into Rome [it] was permitted to Paul to dwell privately, with the soldier watching him. 17 But after three days he summoned [those] who were among the prominent men of the Jews. After they assembled he said to them: “Men, brothers, though I did nothing against the people or the customs from our fathers, I was given over from Jerusalem into [the] hands of [the] Romans. 18 They, after making an inquiry, wished to free me, since [there] was not [any] guilt worthy of death in me. 19 But when the Jews spoke against that, it was necessary for me to put my case before the High King – but not as if I have anything evil to say against my nation. 20 For this reason I therefore requested to see you and to speak to you, for by reason of the hope of Israel I am carrying this chain.” 21 They said to him: “We have not received letters about you from Judea; furthermore; no one of the brothers that have come have said anything bad about you. 22 But we think it is proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for indeed we know about this sect [heren, order] that in every place one speaks against it.”
	23 They fixed a day when they were going to see him and came to where he lived, more numerous than they were the first time. From morning to evening he told and witnessed to them about God's kingdom, and from the Law and from the prophets he tried to give them understanding about Jesus. 24 Some among them listened to his words, but others failed to believe. 25 Since they were split they went away, but Paul said a single saying to them: “Truly the Holy Spirit spoke to your fathers through Isaiah the Prophet, 26 saying: 'Go to this people and say: Indeed you will hear, but you will by no means understand, and indeed you will look, but you will by no means see. 27 For the heart of this people has become blunt, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed – stopping them from perceiving with their eyes and from hearing with their ears and from understanding with their heart and from finding repentance [inwis: change of mind], for me to heal them.' 28 Therefore, may it be known to you that this salvation has been sent to the nations; they will also hear.” 29 And after he said these words, the Jews went away, having a great dispute among themselves.
	30 Then he remained for two years in the house where he paid to live, and he received all that came to him, 31 making God's kingdom known and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without anyone stopping him.
