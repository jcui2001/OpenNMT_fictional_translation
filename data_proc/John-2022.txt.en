Gospel of John
CHAPTER 1
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 Everything was created by means of him, and except by him not a single thing was created. [That] which was created 4 by him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not conquered it.
6 [There] arose a man sent by God; his name was John [or, Johannes]. 7 He came for a witness, that he was to  [Q: will] witness about the light, that all men were going to [Q: will] believe by means of him. 8 He was not this light, but he was to witness about this light.
9 The true light, shining for all men, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, but his own did not receive him. 12 But all who did receive him, to them he gave authority to be children of God, for they had faith in his name; 13 and they were born, not by blood or by flesh or by man’s will, but by God.
14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory, such glory as an only-born son has from his father; and he was full of grace and truth. 15 John witnessed about him; indeed he cried out: “This man is the one of whom I said: [He] who comes behind me is now in front of me, since he existed before me.” 16 For we all received out of his fullness, grace over grace. 17 For the Law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 God nobody has ever seen; the only-born Son who is in the Father’s bosom has made him known.
	19 This is the witness of John when the Jews sent some priests and Levites from Jerusalem to inquire of him: “Who are you?” 20 And he spoke openly and did not deny [it], but said openly: “I am not the Christ.” 21 And they asked him: “Then what? Are you Elijah?” And he said: “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered: “No!” 22 Therefore they said to him: “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 23 He said: “I am a voice crying in the desert: Make the Lord’s way straight! – as Isaiah the Prophet said.” 24 The ones sent [forth] were of the Pharisees. 25 And they asked and said to him: “Then what is the reason that [yanen, “by which”]  you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?” 26 John answered and said: “I baptize with water; in your midst one is standing whom you do not know, 27 [the one] who comes after me, but I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his shoe." 28 These things happened in Bethany [Betania] beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
	29 On the following day he saw Jesus come to him, and he said: “Behold God’s Lamb who takes away the world’s sin! 30 He is the one of whom I said: Look! A man is coming who is now in front of me, for before me he existed. 31  I did not know him, but I came baptizing with water [so] that he was to be revealed to Israel.” 32 John also witnessed, saying: “I saw the Spirit come down out of heaven as a dove, and it remained on him. 33 And I did not know him, but [he] who sent me to baptize with water said to me: The one to whom you shall see the Spirit come down as a dove, he is [the one] who baptizes with Holy Spirit. 34 And I have seen it, and I have witnessed that he is the Son of God.”
	35 On the following day John again stood [forth] with two of his disciples, 36 and seeing Jesus walking he said: “Behold God’s Lamb!” 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they [-tte, dual]  followed Jesus. 38 But Jesus turned [Q: turned himself] and saw them [tú, dual] follow, and he said to them: “What do you [-ste, dual]  seek?” They said to him: “Rabbi” – which means teacher – “where are you staying?” 39 He said to them: “Come and see!” Therefore they came and saw the place where he stayed, and they remained with him on that day. [It] was around the tenth hour. 40 Andrew [Andreas], the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two disciples who [*yet, dual] heard [that] which John said and followed Jesus. 41 He found first his own brother, Simon, and said to him: “We [-mme, dual] have found [the] Messiah!” – which means Christ. 42 He led him to Jesus. When Jesus saw him he said: “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” – which means Peter [= Rock].
	43 On the following day he wanted to go to Galilee [Galilea]. Jesus found Philip and said to him: “Follow me!” 44 Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote: Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.” 46 But Nathanael said to him: “Can a good thing come from Nazareth?” 47 Jesus saw Nathanael come to him and said of him: “Behold a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit [vartie, betrayal]!” 48 Nathanael said to him: “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said: “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49 Nathanael answered him: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel!” 50 Jesus answered and said: “Since I told you that I saw you under the fig tree you believe? You will see some things greater than that.” 51 And he said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you: You will see heaven opened and God’s angels go up and down on the Son of Man.”
CHAPTER 2
On the third day [there] was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there. 2 Also Jesus and his disciples were invited [or “summoned”]  to the wedding.
	2 When they did not have more wine Jesus’ mother said to him: “They are lacking wine.” 4 But Jesus said to her: “Woman, what do I have [to do] with you? My hour still has not come.” 5 His mother said to those who served: “Do everything that he says to you!” 6 [There] stood there six water-vessels, according to the laws of purification of [the] Jews; each water-vessel could take two or three measures. 7 Jesus said to them: “Fill the water-vessels with water!” And they filled them brim full. 8 And he said to them: “Draw [some] from it and take it to the leader of the feast!” So they took it. 9 But when the leader of the feast tasted the water, which was changed into wine, but he did not know where it came from – though the ones who served knew – the leader of the feast called the bridegroom 10 and said to him: “Every other man first puts forth the good wine, and when people are drunk, the inferior. You have put aside  the good wine until now.” 11 Jesus did this in Cana of Galilee as the beginning of his signs and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
	12 Thereafter he and his mother and his disciples went down to Capernaum, but he did not remain there for [ter “through”] many days.
	13 Now [the] Jews’ Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves and the money-changers on their seats. 15 After making a whip of some ropes, he threw them all out together with the sheep and oxen; he poured out the coins [tyelpemittar “silver pieces”]  of the money-changers and overturned the tables. 16 And to those who sold doves he said: “Take these things away from here! Do not make the house of my Father a house of commerce!” 17 The disciples recalled that [it] is written: “The burning feeling for your house will devour me .”
	18 Then the Jews said to him: “What is the sign that you will show us, since you do these things?” 19 Jesus answered and said: “Destroy [nancara, “undo”] this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” 20 Therefore the Jews said: “This temple was built over [ter “through] forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?” 21 But he talked about the temple of his body. 22 Thus, after he was raised from [the] dead, his disciples recalled that he said this, and they believed what the Scripture says and the word that Jesus spoke.
	23 But when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the festival, numerous ones believed in his name, since they saw the signs that he did. 24 But Jesus himself did not open his heart to them, for he knew them all, and because he did not have [any] need that anyone was to witness about a man, for he knew what was in the man. 
CHAPTER 3
There was a man of the Pharisees; his name was Nicodemus, a ruler of [the] Jews. 2 This man came to him in the night and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for [there] is nobody who can do these signs if God is not with him.” 3 Jesus answered and said to him: “Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone is not born again, he cannot see God’s kingdom.” 4 Nicodemus said to him: “How can a person be born when he is old? Can he return to his mother’s womb to be born again?” 5 Jesus answered: “Truly, truly I say to you, if anybody is not born by water and by spirit, he cannot come into God’s kingdom. 6 What is born by flesh is flesh, and what is born by spirit is spirit. 7 Do not wonder because I said to you:  You [pl] must be born again. 8 The wind blows where it wants, and you [sg.]  hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is goes to. So is eveyrone who has been born by the spirit.”
	9 Nicodemus answered and said to him: “How can these things happen?” 10 Jesus answered and said to him: “Are you Israel’s teacher and you do not know these things? 11 Truly, truly I say to you [sg.], what we know we speak and what we have seen we witness [about], but you [pl.] do not receive our witness. 12 If I have told you [pl.] about the things of earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about the things of heaven? 13 Furthermore, nobody has gone up to heaven except [he] who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so [it] is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up, 15 that everybody who believes in him will have eternal life.
	16 For so God has loved the world, that he gave his only-born Son, that everyone who believes in that one shall not be destroyed, but shall have eternal life. 17 For God sent his Son, not for him to judge the world, but for the salvation of the world by that one. 18 [He] who believes in that one shall not be judged. [He] who does not believe has been judged even now, since he has not believed in the name of the only-born Son of God. 19 And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, but Men loved the darkness over the light, for their deeds [/works] are evil. 20 And [he] who does foul things hates the light and does not want to come to the light, [so] that his deeds will not be reproved. 21 But [he] who indeed does what is true comes to the light, [so] that [it] will be manifest that his deeds are done in God.”
	22 After these things Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean region, and there he remained with them and baptized. 23 John was baptizing in Aenon, near to Salim, since [there] was an abundance of water there, and people came and were baptized, 24 for John still was not [= had not yet been] thrown into prison.
	25 Then there was a quarrel between John’s disciples with a Jew concerning purification. 26 And they came to John and said to him: “Rabbi, the man who was with you beyond [the] Jordan, about whom you witnessed, look! he is baptizing and all are going to him.” 27 John answered and said: “A man cannot receive a single thing if it that is not given him from heaven. 28 You yourselves witness to me that I said: I am not the Christ, but I am sent in front of him. 29 [He] who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the bridegroom’s friend, when he stands hearing him, has great joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. Thus this joy of mine is full. 30 He will keep growing, but I will fade away.”
	31 [He] who comes from on high is over all others. [He] who is of earth is from earth, and he speaks of the things of earth. [He] who comes from heaven is over all others. 32 What he has seen and he has heard, about that he witnesses, but no one receives his witness. 33 [He] who has received his witness has put his seal on the faithfulness of God. 34 For [he] whom God sent speaks God’s sayings, for he does not give the Spirit by measure. 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 [He] who believes in the Son has eternal life; [he] who does not do as the Son says will not see life, but God’s wrath remains upon him.
CHAPTER 4
When the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard [Q: has heard] that Jesus was making and baptized [Q: is making and baptizes] disciples more numerous than the disciples of John – 2 though Jesus did not baptize, but his disciples did – 3 he went away from Judea and went again to Galilee. 4 But [it] was necessary for him to go through Galilee. 5 Therefore he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near to the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 6 There was Jacob’s spring. Thus Jesus, tired by the journey, sat down by the spring. The hour was around the sixth.
	7 A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.” 8 For his disciples were gone into the city to buy [lit. trade to themselves] food. 9 Therefore the woman from Samaria said to him: “How do you, who are a Jew, ask for a drink from me who is a Samaritan woman?” For Jews and Samaritans have nothing together. 10 Jesus answered and said to her: “If you knew God’s gift and [the] true-being of [him] who is saying to you: Give me a drink, you asked him, and he gave you living water.”
	11 She said to him: “Lord, you have no water-vessel, and the well is deep. From where, then, do you have the living water? 12 Surely you are not greater than Jacob our father, who gave us the well and who himself drank from it with his sons and his animals?” 13 Jesus answered and said to her: “Everyone who drinks of this water shall be thirsty again. 14 Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will by no means be thirsty, but the water that I will give him will be in him a spring of water that rises up into eternal life.” 15  The woman said to him: “Lord, give me this water, that I will not be thirsty and [it] will not be necessary for me to come here to draw water.”
16 He said to her: “Go, call your husband and come here!” 17 The woman answered and said: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You spoke well: A husband I do not have. 18 For you have had five husbands, and [the one] whom you have now is not your husband, Of this thing you spoke the truth.” 19 The woman said to him: “Lord, I see that you are a prophet. 20 Our fathers gave worship on this mountain, but you [pl.]  say that Jerusalem is the proper place for giving worship.” 21 Jesus said to her: “Believe my word, woman: The hour is coming when you [pl.] will not give worship on this mountain or in Jerusalem alike. 22 You give worship to what you do not know; we give worship to what we know, for salvation comes from [the] Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the father with spirit and with truth, for such worshippers the Father seeks. 24 God is a spirit, and [it] is necessary for [those] who worship him to worship with spirit and with truth.” 25 The woman said to him: “I know that [the] Messiah is coming, [he] who is called Christ. Whenever he shall come, he will tell us everything.” 26 Jesus said to her: “I who am speaking with you am he.”
27 Now his disciples returned, and they wondered because he spoke [/was speaking] with a woman; and yet nobody said: “What do you seek?” or “For what reason are you speaking with her?” [Mana i casta yanen… “what is the reason by which…”] 28 Thus the woman abandoned her water-vessel and went away into the city and said to the people: 29 “Come here, see a man who has told me everything that I have done! Maybe he is the Christ?” 30 They went out of the city and came to him.
31 At the same time the disciples urged him, saying: “Rabbi, eat.” 32 But he said to them: “I have food to eat that you do not know.” 33 Therefore the disiciples said, one to the other: “Did anybody bring him [some]thing to eat?” 34 Jesus said to them: “My food is that I do the will of [him] who sent me and complete his work. 35 Do you not say that [there] are still four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to you: Raise your eyes and behold the fields, that they are white for gathering the harvest. Even now 36 he who sowed is receiving his reward and is gathering produce [or “fruit”, yáve] for eternal life, [so] that he who reaps and he who sowed can have joy together. 37 For here this proverb is true: One has sown and another is reaping. 38 I sent you to reap [that] which you have not worked [on]. Others have worked, and you have entered into their work.”
	39 And in that city many of the Samaritans believe in him by the word of the woman who witnessed: “He told me everything that I did.” 40 Therefore, when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to remain with them; and he remained there for two days. 41 And numerous ones believed by [that] which he said, 42 and they said to the woman: “We do not believe [any]more because of what you said [quetielyanen, “by your saying”], for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the savior of the world.”
	43 After the two days he went away from there to Galilee. 44 But Jesus himself witnessed that in his own place a prophet does not receive honor [laitie, “praising”]. 45 Thus, when he came to Galilee, the people of Galilee received him, because they had seen the things that he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they too went to the festival.
	46 Thus he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he changed the water into wine. And [there] was a king’s servant whose son was ill in Capernaum. 47 When this man heard that Jesus had [Q: has] come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and asked of him that he was to come down to heal his son, for he was near to death. 48 But Jesus said to him: “If you [pl.] do not see signs and wonders, you do not believe at all.” 49 The king’s servant said to him: “Lord, come down before my boy dies.” 50 Jesus said to him: “Go! Your son is alive.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went away. 51 But when he was still on the way his slaves met him to tell him that his son was [Q: is] alive. 52 Therefore he asked them about the hour when he became better [ambe alwa, “more healthy”]. And they said to him: “Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever [úre “heat”]  left him.” 53 Thus the father knew that it happened in the same hour that Jesus said to him: “Your son is alive.” And he and his whole family believed. 54 That was the second sign that Jesus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee. 
CHAPTER 5
After these things there wsa a festival of [the] Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 2 In Jerusalem there is a pool called in Hebrew Bethsatha, having five columnades. 3 In them a multitude was lying: sick ones, blind ones, paralyzed ones and withered ones, waiting for a stirring of the water. 4 For from time to time an angel of the Lord came down into the pool, causing a stirring of the water, and anyone who went first into the pool after the disturbance of the water was healed from every kind of illness that he had. 5 But [there] was  a man there having had his illness for [locative] thirty-eight years. 6 Seeing this man lie there, and knowing that already he was [Q: is ] ill for a long time, Jesus said to him: “Do you want good health?” 7 The sick man answered him: “Lord, I do not have a man to put me in the pool when the water is disturbed, and when I am coming, another goes down before me.” 8 Jesus said to him: “Rise, take up your bed and walk!” 9 And in the same moment the man received good health, and he lifted up his bed and began to walk.
	But that day was a day of rest. 10 Therefore the Jews said to the healed man: “This is a day of rest; carrying the bed is not allowed for you.” 11 But he answered them: “[The one] who gave me good health, he said to me: Take up your bed and walk.” 12 They said to him: “Who is the man who said to you, Take it up and walk – ?” 13 But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had gone away, since [there] was a crowd in the place.
	14 After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, now you have good health! Do not sin [any]more, [so] that something worse [ambe ulca, “more evil”] will not happen to you.” 15 The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was [the] one who gave him good health. 16 And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things in the day of rest. 17 But he answered them: “My father works until now, and so I am working.” 18 For this reason the Jews wanted still more to kill him, for not only did he break the day of rest, but he also called God his own father, making himself like God.
	19 Therefore Jesus answered and said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son cannot do a single thing by himself, but only [that] which he sees the Father doing. For anything which he does, that the Son also does in the same manner. 20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he does, and he shall show him deeds greater than these, [so] that you will marvel. 21 For as the Father raises [the] dead and makes them alive, so also the Son makes those he wants alive. 22 For the Father does not judge anyone, but has given all judgement to the Son, 23 that all will praise the Son as they praise the Father. [He] who does not praise the Son does not praise the Father who sent him. 24 Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who hears my word and believes in [the one] who sent me has eternal life, and he does not come to judgement, but has passed from death to life. 
	25 Truly, truly I say to you: The hour is coming, and it is now, when [the] dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and [those] who hear shall come to life. 26 For as the Father has life in [him]self, so he has given the Son to have life in [him]self. 27 For he has given him authority of judgement, because he is [the] Son of Man.  28 Do not feel wonder about this, because the hour is coming when all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice 29 and will come out, [those] who did good things in a resurrection [enortie “re-raising”] to life, but [those] who did vile things in a resurrection of judgment. 30 I do not do a single thng by [my]self; as I hear I judge, and my judgment is just, for I do not seek my own will, but the will of [him] who sent me.
	31 If I bear witness about [my]self, my witness is not true. 32 There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that his witness about me is true. 33 You sent some people to John, and he has witnessed about the truth. 34 I do not receive [any] man’s witness, but I say these things that maybe you will be saved. 35 That man was a burning and shining lamp, and for [ter, “through”] an hour you wanted to have joy in his light. 36 But I have the witness that is greater than that of John, for the deeds [or, works] that the Father has given me to complete – the deeds that I am doing – those deeds bear witness about me that my Father sent me. 37 Therefore, the Father who sent me, he has witnessed about me. You have not heard his voice or seen his shape, 38 and you do not have my word remaining in you. For [the one] that he sent – in him you do not believe.
39 You search the scriptures, because you think that by them you will have eternal life, and they are [the ones] that bear witness about me. 40 And yet you do not want to come to me, so that you will have life. 41 I do not want to receive glory from men, 42 but I know about you that you do not have love for God in you. 43 I have come in my Father’s name, but you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. 44 How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? 45 Do not think that I will speak about your crimes before the Father. [The one] who speaks about your crimes is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. 46 For if you believed Moses’ saying you believed mine [as well], for he wrote about me. 47 But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe in my sayings? 
CHAPTER 6
After these things Jesus went away crossing the Sea of Galilee, or Sea [of] Tiberias. 2 But a huge crowd followed him, because they saw the signs that he did on the sick. 3 Then Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples. 4 Now the Passover, the festival of [the] Jews, was near.
	5 When Jesus raised his eyes and saw a great crowd come to him, he said to Philip: “Where will we buy [lit. trade to ourselves] breads so that these may eat?” But this he said to test him, for he knew what he was going to do. 7 Philip answered him: “Two hundred denarii are not enough for breads sufficing for them, [so] that each person will receive a small piece.” 8 One of the dciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him: “[There] is here a small boy having five breads of barley and two fishes. But what are they for so many people?”
	10 Jesus said: “Make the men sit down.” [There] was much grass in the place. Therefore the men sat down, a number [of] around five thousand. 11 Then Jesus took the breads, and after giving thanks, he distributed them to the sitting people, and so also the fishes, all that they wanted. 12 But after they were filled [or, sated] he said to his disciples: “Gather the leftover pieces, that nothing will be lost.” 13 Therefore they gathered them, and they filled twelve baskets with pieces of the five breads of barley – the leftovers left over by [those] that had eaten.
	14 Thus, when the men saw the signs that he did, they said: “This man truly is the prophet who was to come into the world.” 15 Therefore Jesus, knowing that now they were going to come and take him to make him king, went away into the mountain, he alone. 
	When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, 17 and having entered a boat they were going over the sea to Capernaum. But now it was dark [literally: (there) was darkness], and Jesus still had not come to them. 18 Furthermore, the sea rose up, because a strong wind was blowing. 19 But having sailed around twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walk on the sea and come near to the boat, and they were afraid. 20 But he said to them: “[It] is I; do not fear!” 21 Therefore they were willing to receive him into the boat, and in the same moment the boat was by the land to which they tried to go. 
	21 On the following day the crowd that stood on the other shore of the sea saw that [there] was not there [any] boat. They had seen that [there] was [Q: is] not another boat except the one, and that Jesus did not go away in [-nen] it with his disciples, but his disciples alone had gone away. 23 But boats from Tiberias came to the place in which they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks. 24 Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus and his disciples alike were [Q: are] not there, they went into their boats and went to Capernaum to seek Jesus.
	25 When they found him on the other side of the sea they asked him: “Rabbi, at what time did you come here? [literally: what (was) the time when you came here?]” 26 Jesus answered them and said: “Truly, truly I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the breads and were filled [/sated]. 27 Work, not for the food that will pass away, but for the food that remains for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father, God, has set his seal.”
	28 Therefore they said to him: “What are we to do in order to do God’s work?” 29 Jesus answered and said to them: “This is God’s work, that you are to believe in [the one] whom he sent.” 30 Therefore they said to him: “What, then, are you doing as a sign, [so] that we will see it and we are going to believe in you? What are you doing? 31 Our fathers ate the manna [Hebrew: mán] in the desert, as is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.” 32 Therefore Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you: Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father indeed gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For God’s bread is [he] who comes down from heaven and gives light to the world.” 34 Therefore they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread!”
	35 Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. [He] who comes to me will not ever be hungry, and [he] who believes in me will not ever be thirsty. 36 But I have said to you: you have seen me, and yet you do not believe. 37 Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and [he] who comes to me I will by no means throw out, 38 because I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of [him] who sent me. 39 This is the will of [him] who sent me, that nothing will be lost to me of all that he has given me, but I will raise it up again at the last day.”
41 Then the Jews murmurmed at him because he said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” 42 And they said: “Is this man not Jesus son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How may he say: I have come down from heaven – ?” 43 Jesus answered and said to them: “Do not be murmuring among yourselves. 44 Nobody can come to me if the Father who sent me does not draw him, and I shall raise him up again at the last day. 45 For [it] is written in the Prophets: And all among them shall be taught by the Lord. Everybody who has heard from the Father and has learnt comes to me. 46 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except [he] who is from God; he has seen the Father. 47 Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who believes has eternal life.
48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the desert, and yet they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, that anyone can eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that comes down from heaven; if anybody eats of this bread he will live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.” 
	52 Therefore the Jews quarreled one with the other, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 Thus Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves. 54 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up again at the last day. 55 For my flesh is real food, and my blood is a real drink. 56 [He] who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father sent me and I have life by the Father, so also [he] who eats me will have life by me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your fathers ate and yet died. [He] who eats this bread will live forever.” 59 These things he said when he was teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum.
	60 Therefore numerous ones of his disciples, when they heard this, said: “This saying is hard; who can listen to it?” 61 But Jesus, knowing by himself that his disiciples murmured about this, said to them: “Does this disturb you? 62 What, then, if you will see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 The spirit is what gives life; the flesh does nothing beneficial. The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. 64 But [there] are among you some people who do not believe.” For from the beginning Jesus knew [those] who did not believe and who was the one who was to betray him. 65 And he said: “For this reason I have said to you: Nobody can come to me if that is not given him by the Father.”
	66 Thereafter numerous ones of his disciples went away to the things behind them and did not want to walk with him [any]more. 67 Therefore Jesus said to the twelve: “Do you not want to go away, you too?” 68 Simon Peter answered him: “Lord, to whom are we to go? You have sayings of eternal life, 69 and we have believed and we know that you are the Holy One of God.” 70 Jesus answered them: “Have I not chosen you twelve? And among you one is a devil!” 71 He talked about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For this man, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.  
CHAPTER 7 
And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he did not want to walk in Judea, since the Jews sought to kill him. 2 But the festival of [the] Jews, the Feast of Leaf-huts, was near. 3 Therefore his brothers said to him: “Go away from here and go into Judea, that also your disciples will see the deeds that you do! 4 For nobody does anything secretly if he seeks to be known. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world!”  6 Therefore Jesus said to them: “My hour still has not come, but to you the hour is always ready. 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, for I witnessed about it that its deeds are evil. 8 You go up to the festival! I do not go up to this festival, for my hour still has not come.” 9 After saying these things to them he remained in Galilee.
	10 But after his brothers went to the festival, he too went up, not openly, but secretly. 11 Therefore the Jews sought him at the festival and said: “Where is that man?” 12 And there was much murmuring about him among the crowds. Some people said: “He is a good man.” Others said: “He is not, but he causes the crowd to err!” 13 Of course [lit. “as (is) understood” = self-evident], nobody talked openly about him, for they feared the Jews.
	14 When half of the festival had passed, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. 15 Therefore the Jews were in wonder, saying: “How does this man know the Scriptures when he has not learnt lore?” 16 Jesus therefore answered them and said: “What I teach is not mine, but is of [him] who sent me. 17 If anybody wants to do his will, he shall know concerning the teaching if it is from God or if I speak out of myself. 18  [He] who speaks out of himself is seeking his own glory; but [he] who seeks the glory of the person who sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. 19 Did not Moses give you the Law? But nobody among you does as the Law says. For what reason are you seeking to kill me?” 20 The crowd answered: “You are possessed by a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?” 21 Jesus answered and said to them: “One deed I did, and you were all in wonder. 22 For this reason Moses gave you the circumcision – not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers – and  you circumcise a man at a day of rest. 23 If a man receives circumcision on the day of rest, that the law of Moses is not to be broken, are you angry at me because I gave perfect health to a man on the day of rest? 24 Do not judge as you see, but judge justly!”
	25 Therefore some people from Jerusalem said: “Is not he the one that they are seeking to kill? 26 And look! he is speaking openly, and they say nothing to him. Surely the rulers have not really found that he is the Christ? 27 But we know from where this man is. When [the] Messiah shall come, nobody will know from where he is.”
	28 Therefore Jesus, when he taught in the temple, cried out and said: “Me you know, you know also from where I am. I have not come by myself, but [he] who sent me is true, he whom you do not know. 29 I know him, for from him I come, and he sent me.” 30 Then they tried to seize him, but nobody laid his hand on him, for his time still had not come. 31 But numerous ones of the crowd believed in him and said: “When the Christ shall come, surely he will not do deeds more numerous than [the ones] that this man has done?”
32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent some officers to seize him. 33 Therefore Jesus said: “I will still be with you a short time, before I shall go away to [the one] who sent me. 34 You will seek me, but you will not find me, for where I am you cannot come.” 35 Therefore the Jews said among themselves: “Where will this man go away to, that we will not find him? Surely he will not go away to [those] who are scattered among the Greek, in order to teach the Greek? 36 What does this saying mean that he said: You will seek me, but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come – ?”
	37 But on the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood up and cried out, saying: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me to drink! 38 [He] who believes in me, from his innermost part [there] will flow streams of living water, as the Scripture has said.” 39 But this he said about the spirit that [those] were to receive who believed in him. For still there was no spirit, for Jesus still was not glorified. 40 Therefore some of the crowd that heard these words said: “This person is indeed the Prophet.” 41 Others said: “This is the Christ.” But [there] were [those] who said: “Surely the Christ does not come from Galilee? 42 Does not the Scripture say that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?” 43 Therefore [there] was a split concerning him in the crowd. 44 But some people among them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him. 
	45 Therefore the officers returned to the chief priests and to the Pharisees, and they said to them:  “How [is it that] you are not bringing him with you?” 46 The officers said: “No man has ever spoken like this.” 47 The Pharisees therefore answered: “Sure you are not misled as well? 48 Has anyone among the rulers or Pharisees believed in him? 49 But this crowd that does not know the Law, they are accursed!”
	50 Nicodemus, one among them who had come to him formerly, said to them: 51 “Surely our Law does not judge a man unless one has first given him a hearing and knows what he has done?” 52 They answered him: “Are you too from Galilee? Search and see that a prophet will not be raised up out of Galiliee.” 53 Then they went away, everyone to his house.
CHAPTER 8
But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 At dawn he returned to the temple, and the whole people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. 3 But the scribes [ingolmor “loremasters”] and the Pharisees brought to him a woman [who had been] seized in adultery. Placing her in their midst 4 they said to Jesus: “Teacher, this woman has been seized in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded that we are to kill such women by throwing stones at them. What, then, do you say?” 6 They said this to test him, that they were to have a thing by which they could accuse him. But he bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger. 7 When they asked him persistently, he arose and said to them: “Let [him] who is without sin throw at her the first stone!” 8 And again bending down be wrote on the ground. 9 But [those] who heard this went away, one ofter one, the elders first, until he remained alone with the woman who stood in their midst. 10 Jesus arose and said to her: “Woman, where are they? Did nobody judge you?” 11 She said: “Nobody, lord.” Jesus said: “Also I do not [= Neither do I…] judge you. Go; from now [on] do not sin [any]more.”
	12 Then Jesus talked to them again, saying: “I am the light of the world. [He] who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” 13 Thus the Pharisees said to him: “You witness about [your]self; your witness is not true.” 14 Jesus answered and said: “Even if I witness about [my]self, my witness is true, since I know from whom I come and where I go away. 15 You judge by the flesh; I do not judge anyboy at all.  16 And yet, if I do judge, my judgement is true, since I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. 17 Furthermore, in your own Law [it] is written: The witness of two men is true. 18 I am one who witnesses about [my]self, and the Father who sent me witnesses about me.” 19 Therefore they said to him: “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “You fail to know me and my father alike. If you knew me, you knew also my Father.” 20 These sayings he spoke in the treasury when he taught in the temple. But nobody seized him, since his time still had not come. 
21 Thus he said to them again: “I go away, and you will seek me, and yet you will die in your sin. To where I go away you cannot come. 22 Therefore the Jews said: “Surely he will not kill himself? Since he says: To where I go you cannot come.” 23 But he said to them: “You are from the low [places]; I am from the high places. You are from this world; I am not from this world. 24 Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”
25 Therefore they said to him: “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “[I am] who I told you from the beginning. 26 I have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But [he] who sent me is true, and the things that I heard from him I speak in the world.” 27 They did not understand that he spoke to them about the Father. 28 Therefore Jesus said: “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing by myself [or, on my own initiative], but as the Father taught me I speak these things. 29 And [he] who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I always do [that] which is pleases him.” 30 When he said these things, many believed in him.
	31 Therefore Jesus said to the Jews that believed in him: “If you remain in my word, you are truly my disciples, 32 and you shall know the truth, and the truth will free you.” 33 They answered him: “We are Abraham’s seed, and we have not ever been anybody’s slaves. How can you say: You shall be free – ? 34 Jesus answered them: “Truly, truly I say to you: Everyone who does [or, commits] sin is a slave of the sin. 35 Furthermore, the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. 36 Therefore, if the Son frees you, you will indeed be free. 37 I know that you are Abraham’s seed; but you are seeking to kill me, for my word does not find [any] place among you. 38 [The things] that I have seen beside my Father I speak; and in the same manner you do [the things] that you have heard from your father.” 39 They answered him: “Our father is Abraham!” Jesus said to them: “If you are Abraham’s children, do Abraham’s deeds! 40 But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do so. 41 You do the deeds of your father.” They said to him: “We are not born by fornication; we have a single Father, God.”
	42 Jesus answered them: “If God was your Father, you loved me, for from God I have come forth and I am here. Furthermore, I did not come by [my]self, but he sent me. 43 How [is it that] do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot listen to my word. 44 You are of your father, the Devil, and you want to do your father’s desires. He was a manslayer from the beginning, and he did not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie he speaks out of his own [things], because he is a liar and the father of the lie. 45 But because I say to you the truth, you do not believe my word. 46 Who among you rebukes me about sin? If I speak truth, how [is it that] you do not believe what I say? 47 [He] who is from God listens to the sayings of God. Because of [-nen] this you do not listen, for you are not from God.” 
48 The Jews said to him: “Do we not say well [= rightly] that you are a Samaritan and possessed by a demon?” 49 Jesus answered: “I am not possessed by a demon, but I honor [or “praise”] my Father, and you dishonor me. 50 But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge. 51 Truly, truly I say to you: If anyone keeps my word, he shall by no means ever see death. 52 The Jews said to him: “Now we know indeed that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets, but you say: If anyone abides by my word, he shall by no means ever see death. 53 Surely you are not greater than Abraham our father, who died? Also the prophets died. What do you make [of] [your]self? 54 Jesus answered: “If I will give glory to myself, my glory is nothing. [He] who gives me glory is my Father, who you say is your God, 55 and yet you do not know him. But I know him. And if I said that I do not know him, I were like you – lying. But I know him, and his word I keep. 56 Abraham your father had great joy at the thought that he was to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.” 57 Therefore the Jews said to him: “You still do not have [an age of] fifty years, and yet you have seen Abraham?” 58 Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” 59 Therefore they picked up stones to throw them at him, but Jesus hid himself and went away from the temple.
CHAPTER 9
When he passed by, he saw a man blind from the womb. 2 And his disciples inquired of him: “Rabbi, who has sinned, this man or his parents, since he was born blind?” 3 Jesus answered: “This man did not sin,  or his parents, but this happened [so] that God’s deeds were to be revealed by means of him. 4 [It] is necessary for us to do the work of [him] who sent me while [it] is day; the night is coming when nobody can work. 5 While I am in the world, I am the world’s light.” 6 After he said these things, he spat on the ground and made a mud with the spit, and he put the mud upon the man’s eyes 7 and said to him: “Go, wash [your]self in the pool called Siloam” – which means Sent. And so he went away and washed himself, and he returned seeing. 
	8 Therefore the neighbors and [those] who formerly saw that he was [Q: is] a beggar said: “This man is [he] who sat begging, no?” 9 Some people said: “It is he.” Others said: “No, but he is like him in appearance.” The man said: “I am he!”
	10 Therefore they said to him: “How, then, were your eyes opened?” 11 He answered: “The man called Jesus made a mud and put it on my eyes and said to me: Go to Siloam and wash yourself. Therefore I went and washed [my]self, and then I could see.” 12 And they said to him: “Where is that man?” He said: “I do not know.”
	13 They brought the man who formerly was blind to the Pharisees. 14 But [it] was a day of rest on the day that Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. 15 So also the Pharisees asked him about how he received sight. He said to them: “He put a mud on my eyes and I washed [my]self, and I can see.” 16 Therefore some of the Pharisees said: “This man is not from God, since he does not keep the day of rest.” Others said: “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And [there] was a split among them. 17 Therefore they said to the blind man again: “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?” The man said: “He is a prophet.”
	18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him that formerly he was blind and had received sight, until they called his parents of the man who received sight. 19 And they asked them: “Is this person your son, who you say was born blind? How, then, [is it that] he can see now?” 20 Thus his parents answered: “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. 21 But how he can see now we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know.  Ask him! He is an adult man. He can speak for [him]self.” 22 His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for beforehand the Jews had come to an agreement [lit. had become of one mind] that if anyone confessed Jesus as Christ, he was to be excluded from the synagogue.  23 Because of this his parents said: “He is an adult man; ask him.”
	24 Therefore they called for a second time the man who formerly was blind and said to him: “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.” 25 But he answered: “If [/whether] he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I know, that after being blind I now see.” 26 Therefore they said to him: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” 27 He said to them: “I told you before, and you did not listen. What is the reason that you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?” 28 And they abused him and said: “You are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses. 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but of this man we do not know where he is from.” 30 The man answered and said to them: “This is indeed a wonder, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes! 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anybody fears God and does his will, he listens to him. 32 From of old nobody has ever heard that anybody opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 33 If this man was not from God, he could do nothing.” 34 They answered him: “You were born wholly in sins, and yet you teach us?” And they threw him out.
	35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and having found him he said: “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” 36 The man answered: “And who is he, lord, that I can believe in him?” 37 Jesus said to him: “You have seen him; indeed he is [the one] who is speaking with you.” 38 Then he said: “I believe, Lord!” And he threw himself down before him. 39 And Jesus said: “For judgment I came into this world, that the blind will be able to see, and that the seeing will become blind.” 40 Some of the Pharisees that were with him heard these things, and they said to him: “Surely we are not blind as well?” 41 Jesus said to them: “If you were blind, you had no sin. But now you say: We see. Your sin remains.” 
CHAPTER 10
“Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who does not come in to the sheep through the door, but climbs up in another place, that person is a thief and a robber. 2 But [he] who comes in through the door is [the] shepherd of the sheep. 3 To him the door-watcher opens, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them outside. 4 When he has led his own outside, he walks before them, and the sheep follow him, since they know his voice. 5 A strange person they do not follow, but they flee from him, since they do not know the voice of strangers.” 6 Jesus spoke this comparison to them, but they did not understand [the things] that he said to them.
	7 Therefore Jesus said to them again: “Truly, truly I say to you: I am the door of the sheep. 8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. 9 I am the door; anyone who comes in through me will be saved, and he will go in and out and will find pasturage. 10 The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come that they will have life and they will have abundance. 11 I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd gives his life on behalf of the sheep. 12 The paid man, who is not a shepherd and [yeva =] of whom the sheep are not his own, sees the wolf come and flees – and the wolf seizes them and scatters them – 13 since he is a paid man and the sheep are not important to him. 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me, 15 as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I give my life on behalf of the sheep.
	16 I have also some other sheep, that are not among these sheep; them as well [it] is necessary for me to lead, and they will listen to my voice, and they will be a single flock, a single shepherd. 17 By this reason the Father loves me, since I give my life, that I can receive it back. 18 Nobody has taken it from me, but I give it by my own will. I have authority to give it, and I have authority to receive it again. The command about this I received from my Father.”
	19 Because of these words there was another split among the Jews. 20 Numerous ones among them said: “He is possessed by a demon and is out of his mind! How is [it] that you listen to him?” 21 Others said: “These are not the sayings of a demon-possessed man. Surely a demon cannot open the eyes of blind [people]?” 
22 At that time there was the festival of renewal in Jerusalem. It was winter, 23 and Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s columnade. 24 Therefore the Jews surrounded him and said to him: “How long will you keep us in uncertainty? If you are the Christ, tell us openly!” 25 Jesus answered them: “I told you, and yet you do not believe. The deeds that I am doing in my Father’s name, they witness about me. 26 But you do not believe, since you are not of my sheep. 27 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 28 And I give them eternal life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed, and nobody will snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all others, and nobody can snatch them out of the Father’s hand. 30 I and the Father are [nát, dual] one.”
31 Again the Jews picked up stones to throw them at him. 32 Jesus answered them: “I showed you many good deeds from the Father. Concerning what [or, which] of those deeds do you want to throw stones at me?” 33 The Jews answered him: “We are throwing stones at you, not concerning [any] good deed, but concerning blasphemy, and since you who are a man makes [your]self a god!” 34 Jesus answered them: “Is it not written in your Law: I said: You are gods – ? 35 If he called gods the people to whom God’s word came – and the Scripture one cannot put away – 36 do you say to me whom the Father hallowed and sent into the world: You blaspheme, since I said, I am God’s son – ? 37 If I do not do my Father’s deeds, do not believe what I say [quetienyar “my sayings”]. 38 But if I am doing them, and you do not believe my sayings, believe the deeds, that you will know and you will understand that the Father is in me and I [am] in the Father.”  39 Therefore they tried again to seize him, but he escaped out of their hands [máltalto, distributive dual in ablative].
40 And he went away again beyond Jordan, to the place where John baptized in the beginning, and there he remained. 41 And numerous [people] came to him, and they said: “John did not do a single sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.” 42 And many believed in him there. 
CHAPTER 11
[There] was a man who was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and Martha her sister. 2 The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill was the woman who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and dried his feet with her hair. 3 Therefore the sisters sent word to him, saying: “Lord, see! [he] whom you love is ill.” 4 But when Jeus heard it he said: “This illness is not for death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of Man will have glory by it.”
	5 Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6 But when he heard that he was [Q: is] ill, he remained for two days in the place where he was. 7 Thereafter, after this, he said to the disciples: “Let us go into Judea again.” 8 The disciples said to him: “Rabbi, a short time ago the Jews sought to kill you with stones, and you are going there again?” 9 Jesus answered: “[There] are twelve hours of a day, no? If anyone walks at day, he does not fall, since he sees the light of this world. 10 But if anyone walks at night, he falls, since the light is not in him.”
	11 He said these things, and then he said to them: “Lazarus our friend has lain down to rest, but I will go there to wake him up.” 12 Therefore the disciples said to him: “Lord, if he has lain down to rest, he will be well.” 13 Jesus spoke about his death, but they thought that he spoke about resting in sleep. 14 Therefore Jesus then said to them openly: “Lazarus has died; 15 and for your good I am glad that I was not there, that you will believe. But let us go to him.” 16 Therefore Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples: “Let us go, we too, that we will die with him.”
	17 Thus Jesus, when he came, found that Lazarus had already been lying four days in the grave. 18 Bethany was near to Jerusalem, like one and a half league from it. 19 Thus many of [the] Jews were come to Martha and to Mary to comfort them [tú, dual] about their [-tta, dual] brother. 20 Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus came, met him; but Mary remained in the house. 21 Thus Martha said to Jesus: “Lord, if you were here, my brother was not dead. 22 And yet I know that everything that you make petition about from God, God will give you.” 23 Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.” 24 Martha said to him: “I know that he will rise in the resurrection [enortie, “re-rising”] on the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her: “I [am] the resurrection and the life. [He] who believes in me, [even] though if he dies, shall come to life, 26 and everyone who is alive and believes in me shall not ever die. Do you believe this?” 27 She said to him: “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who was to come into the world.” 28 And after saying this she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly: “The Teacher is here, and he is calling you.” 29 She, hearing this, arose quickly and went to him.
	30 Jesus still had not come into the village, but he was still in the place where Martha met him. 31 When the Jews who were with Mary in the house to comfort her saw that she arose and went out [Q: she arises and goes out], they therefore followed her, supposing that she was going to the grave to weep there.  32 And so Mary, when she came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, fell before his feet, saying to him: “Lord, if you were here my brother was not dead!” 33 Thus Jesus, when he saw that she cried [Q: cries], and that the Jews who were with her cried [Q: cry], groaned in his spirit and was shaken. 34 And he said: “Where have you put him?” They said to him: “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus cried. 36 Therefore the Jews said: “See how he loved him!” 37 But some among them said: “Could not this man who opened the blind [man]’s eyes stop this man from dying?” 
	38 Thus Jesus, after groaning again in [him]self, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay before it. 39 Jesus said: “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead, said to him: “Lord, [by] now [there] is a stench, for he has lain there for four days!” 40 Jesus said to her: “Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see God’s glory?” 41 Then they took away the stone. Jesus raised his eyes and said: “Father, I thank you because you have heard me. 42 I know that you always hear me, but for the good of the crowd that is standing here I spoke, that they will believe that you sent me.” 43 And after saying this he cried out in a mighty voice: “Lazarus, come out!” 44 And the man having died came out, restrained on his feet and on his hands by wraps, and having a cloth bound over his face. Jesus said to them: “Release him and let him go!”
45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary and saw what he did believed in him. 46 But some among them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus did. 47 Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Council and said: “What are we to do, since this man does many signs? 48 If we let him continue so, all will believe in him, and [the] Romans will come and will take away both our holy place and our nation.” 49 But one among them, Caiaphas, who was the chief priest that year, said to them: “You do not know a single thing, 50 and you do not understand that it is beneficial for you that a single man is to die on behalf of the people, that the whole nation will not be undone.” 51 But that he did not say of himself, but because he was the chief priest, he spoke as a prophet that Jesus was destined to die for the nation, 52 and not only for the nation, but for him to be able to gather into one the Children of God that are scattered. 53 Therefore from that day they made plans to kill him.
54 Therefore Jesus did not [any]more walk openly among [the] Jews, but he went away from there to the land near to the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he remained with his disciples. 55 Now the Passover of [the] Jews was near, and many came up out of the regions to purify themselves.
56 Therefore they sought Jesus and said, one to the other: “What are you thinking? That he will not come to the festival at all?” 57 The chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew [Q: knows]  where he was [Q: is], it obliges for him to tell, for them to be able to seize him. 
CHAPTER 12
Thus Jesus, six days before the festival, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus whom Jesus raised from [the] dead. 2 Therefore they made for him an evening meal, and Mary served, but Lazarus was among those who lay by the table with him. 3 Then Mary took a pound of fragrant oil – genuine, most precious nard – and anointed Jesus’ feet and dried his feet with her hair. The scent of the fragrant oil filled the house. 4 But Judas Iscariot, one among his disciples, who was going to betray him, said: 5 “How [is it that] this fragrant oil was not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?” 6 He said this, not because the poor were important to him, but because he was a thief: Having the moneybox he took  [the coins] that were put in it. 7 Therefore Jesus said: “Do not hinder her! Let her keep it for the day when I shall be brought to my grave. 8 For the poor you always have with you, but me you do not always have.”
	9 When a huge crowd of Jews understood that he was [Q: is] there, they came, not solely because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he raised from [the] dead. 10 But the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, 11 since because of him many of [the] Jews went there and believed in Jesus.
	12 On the following day, when the huge crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming [Q: is coming] to Jerusalem, 13 they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. And they cried: “Hosanna! Blessed is [he] who comes in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel!” 14 But after finding a young ass he sat down on it, as is written: 15 “Do not fear, daughter of Zion! Look! Your king is coming, sitting on the colt [onna, child/offspring] of an ass.” 16 The disciples did not understand these things from the beginning, but when Jesus was made glorious , then they recalled how these things were written about him and that they did so to him.
	17 Thus [they] witnessed, the people that were with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from [the] dead. 18 Because of this the crowd, when they heard that he did this sign, also met him. 19 Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves: “You see that you can do nothing. Look! The world has gone behind him.”  
	20 [There] were some Greeks [or, Hellenes] among [those] who went up to worship at the festival. 21 Therefore they came to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked of him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” 22 Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.
	23 But Jesus answered them, saying: “The hour has come when the Son of Man will be glorified. 24 Truly, truly I say to you: If a grain of seed does not fall into the ground and dies, it remains the [/ that] single grain; but if it dies, then it bears much fruit. 25 [He] who loves his life will destroy it, but [he] who hates his life in this world will protect it for eternal life. 26 If anyone wants to serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. 27 Now my soul is troubled, and what am I to say? Father, save me from this hour! But for this reason I have come to this hour. 28 Father, glorify your name!” Therefore a voice came out of heaven: “I both glorified it and I shall glorify it again!”
	29 Therefore the crowd that stood there and heard it said that it was thunder. Others said: “An angel has spoken to him.” 30 Jesus answered and said: “This voice did not come for my good, but for yours. 31 Now this world is being judged, now the ruler of this world will be thrown out! 32 And I, when I shall be lifted up out of earth, will draw all men to me.” 33 But that he said to show the kind of death that he was going to die. 34 Therefore the crowd answered him: “We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever, and how may you say that [it] is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” 35 Jesus therefore said to them: “The light will be among you for a short while more. Walk while you have the light, or darkness will conquer you, for [he] who walks in the dark does not know where he goes. 36 When you have the light, believe in the light, that you will be sons of light.” 
	These things Jesus said, and he went away and hid himself from them. 37 But though he had done so many signs in front of them, they did not believe in him, 38 in order to fulfill the word that Isaiah the Prophet spoke: “Lord, who has believed what we have heard? And the arm of the Lord, to whom was it revealed?” 39 The reason why [yanen “by which”] it was not possible for them to believe is that again Isaiah said: 40 “I will make their eyes blind and their heart hard, that they do not see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn [Q: turn themselves], [so] that I would heal them.” 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke about him. 42 And yet many also of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they that they were not going to be excluded from the synagogue. 43 For they loved the glory of [or “from”, -llon] men more than the glory of [/from] God.
	44 But Jesus cried [out] and said: “[He] who believes in me does not believe in me, but in [him] who sent me, 45 and [he] who see me sees also [he] who sent me. 46 I have come as a light into the world, and everyone who believes in me shall not remain in the darkness. 47 But if anyone hears my sayings and does not heed them, I do not judge him, for I came, not to judge the world, but to save the world. 48 [He] who disregards me and does not keep my sayings has [something] that judges him. The word that I have spoken is what shall judge him in the last day; 49 since I have not spoken by myself, but the Father who sent me, he has given me command about what I will l say and I will speak. 50 And I know that his command is eternal life. Therefore, the things that I speak – as the Father has spoken them to me, so I speak. 
CHAPTER 13
Before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that now his time had [Q: has] come to pass away from this world to go to the Father, and after loving his own who were in the world, he loved them until the end. 2 They were eating the evening meal, and the Devil had beforehand put [it] into the heart of Judas Iscariot son of Simon that he was going to betray him. 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had [Q: has] given all things into his hands, and that he had [Q: has] come forth from God and was to go [Q: will go]to God, 4 arose from the evening meal and put away his raiments. He took a linen cloth and girded himself. Thereafter he poured water into a bowl, and he started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them with linen cloth with which he was girded. 6 Thus he came to Simon Peter. He said to him: “Lord, are you washing my feet?” 7 Jesus answered and said to him: “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand it after these things.” 8 Simon Peter said to him: “By no means will you ever wash my feet!” Jesus answered him: “If I do not wash you, you do not have [any] part with me.” 9 Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!” 10 Jesus answered him: “[He] who has washed himself does not have need that anything is to be washed except his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean – but not all.” 11 For he knew the man betraying him. Therefore he said: “You are not all clean.” 
	12 After washing their feet and taking his robes he laid down again by the table and said to them: “Do you know what I have done to you? 13 You say to me: Teacher and Lord, and you speak well, for that I am. 14 Therefore, if I, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, [it] is also your duty [rohta “debt”] that you wash one another’s feet. 15 For I have set for you an example, [so] that as I have done, you too will do. 16 Truly, truly I say to you: A servant is not greater than his lord, or a person sent [forth] than [the one] who sent him. 17 If you know these things, happy you are if you do them. 18 I do not speak of you all; I know [the ones] that I have chosen. But it happens to fulfill the scripture: [He] who ate my bread has turned his back on me. 19 From this moment I tell you before it happens; thus, when it shall happen, you will believe that I am he. 20 Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who receives anybody that I send receives me, and [he] who receives me, receives [him] who sent me.”
	21 After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and he witnessed and said: “Truly, truly I say to you: One among you will betray me.” 22 The disciples looked on one another, not understanding about whom he spoke. 23 Before Jesus’ bosom [there] lay one of his disiciples, whom Jesus loved. 24 Therefore Simon Peter gave a hint to that one and said to him: “Tell who [it] is that he is talking about!” 25 Thus the disciple, leaning towards Jesus’ chest, said to him: “Lord, who is he?” 26 Therefore Jesus answered: “He is [the one] to whom I will give the piece of bread that I dip.” After dipping the piece he gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot. 27 And after receiving the piece, then Satan entered him. Therefore Jesus said to him: “What you are doing, do it quickly!” 28 But nobody among [those] who were lying by the table knew the reason why [yanen “by which”] he said this to him. 29 And some thought, since Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him: “Buy [the things] that we have need of for the festival,” or that he was to [Q: will] give something to the poor. 30 Therefore, having received the piece, he went out in the same moment. And [it] was night.
	31 Thus, after he went out, Jesus said: “Now the Son of Man is being glorified, and God is being glorified by means of him. 32 If God is being glorified by means of him, God himself will also glorify him, and he will glorify him soon. 33 My children, I am with you for a little while more. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews: Where I am going away you cannot come, so I say also to you now. 34 A new command I give you: to love one another. Just as I have loved you, so you too are to love one another. 35 By this all shall know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”
	36 Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, where do you go away to?” Jesus answered: “Where I am go away you cannot follow me now, but you will follow after[wards].” 37 Peter said to him: “Lord, how [is it that] I cannot follow you now? I will give my life for you!” 38 Jesus answered: “Will you give your life for me? Truly, truly I say to you: A cock will by no means sound before you have denied me thrice.”
CHAPTER 14
“Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. 2 In my Father’s house [there] are many rooms. If not, I told you [so], since I am going away to prepare a place for you. 3 Furthermore, if I go away and prepare a place for you, I shall return and receive you to myself, that where I am you too will be. 4 And where I am going away you know the way.”
5 Thomas said to him: “Lord, we do not know where you are going away to. How do we know the way?” 6 Jesus said to him: “I [am] the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you knew me, you knew also my Father. From this moment you know him and you have seen him.”
8 Philip said to him: “Lord, show us the Father, and that is enough [farya “suffices”] for us.” 9 Jesus said to him: “So long I have been with you [pl.], Philip, and yet you [sg.] do not know me? [He] who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you [sg.] say: Show us the Father – ?10 Do you [sg.] not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The things that I have spoken to you [pl.] I have not spoken out of myself, but the Father who remains in me is doing his deeds. 11 Believe me that I am in the Fatehr and the Father in me; if not, believe because of the deeds as such! 12 Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who believes in me, he will do also the deeds that I do; and he will do deeds greater than they [or, those], since I am going away to the Father. 13 And everything that you pray for in my name, that I will do, [so] that] the Father will be glorified by means of the Son. 14 If you pray for [any]thing in my name, I will do it.
15 If you love me, you will remain in my commandments, 16 and I will ask of the Father, and he will give you another helper that will be with you forever, 17 the Spirit of truth, that the world cannot receive, since it fails to see it and know it alike. You know it, since it remains in you and is in you. 18 I do not leave you orphaned. I am coming to you. 19 After a little while more the world will not see me [any]more, but you will see me, since I am alive and you shall be alive. 20 On that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you. 21 [He] who has my commandments and abides by them, he is [the one] who loves me. Furthermore, [he] who loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal [my]self to him.”
	22 Judas, not Iscariot, said to him: “Lord, what has happened, since you will reveal [your]self to us and not to the world?” 23 Jesus answered him and said: “If anyone loves me, he will abide by my word, and my Father will love him, and we [dual] will come to him and will dwell with him. 24 [He] who does not love me does not abide by my words, and the word that you are hearing is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
	25 While I remain with you I have spoken these things to you. 26 But the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father shall send in my name, he will teach you all things and will make you remember everything that I told you. 27 Peace I let remain with you, my peace I give you. I do not give it as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled or frightened! 28 You heard that I said to you that I am going away and I will return to you. If you loved me, you had joy because of my going to the Father, since the Father is greater than I. 29 And now I have told you before it happens, that, when it does happen, you will believe. 30 I will not talk much with you from now [on], for the ruler of the world is coming. And he does not have power over me, 31 but that the world will know that I love the Father, therefore I am doing according to the command that the Father has given me. Rise, let us go from here!” 
CHAPTER 15 
“I [am] the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator. 2 Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every [one] that bears fruit he cleanses, for it to bear more fruit. 3 You are already clean, by the word that I have spoken to you. 4 Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit if it does not remain in the vine, so you cannot [either], if you do not remain in me. 5 I am the vine, you are the branches. [He] who remains in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for away from me you can do nothing. 6 If anybody does not remain in me, he is thrown outside as a branch and becomes dry, and people gather those branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burnt. 7 If you remain in me and my sayings remain in you, pray for everything that you want, and it will happen for you. 8 My father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and show yourselves as my disciples. 9 As the Father has loved me and I have loved you, remain in my love! 10 If you abide by my commandments, you will remain in my love, as I have abided by the Father’s commandments and remain in his love.
	11 These things I have spoken to you, that my joy will be in you and your joy will be made full. 12 This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 13 Nobody has a love greater than this, that a person gives his life for his friends. 14 You are my friends if you do what I command you. 15 I do not [any]more call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his lord does. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you, and I have appointed you to go out and to bear fruit, and your fruit will remain, [so] that the Father will give you what you pray for in my name. 17 These things I command you, that you will love one another. 18 If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before you. 19 If you were a part of the world, the world loved its own. But because you are not a part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, for this [reason] the world hates you. 20 Recall the word that I spoke to you: A slave is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, you too they will persecute. If they have abided by my word, they will abide by yours also. 21 But they will do all these things to you because of my name, since they do not know [the one] who sent me. 22 If I did [or, had] not come and talked to them, they did [/would] not have [any] sin; but now they do not have [any] reason to give concerning their sin. 23 [He] who hates me hates also my Father. 24 If I had not done among them the deeds that nobody else has done, they did not have [any] sin; but now they have seen and they have looked at me and my Father alike.  25 But it happens in order to fulfill the word written in their Law:  They hated me without reason. 26 When the Helper shall come whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth, who comes forth from the Father, he will witness about me; 27 you as well will witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.” 
CHAPTER 16
“These things I have spoken to you that you will not be made to fall. 2 People will exclude you from the synagogue. Indeed the hour is coming when everyone killing you will believe that so he serves God. 3 But they will do these things since they do not know the Father or me alike. 4 But these things I have spoken to you that you will recall that I told you about them when their time comes. These things I did not say to you from the beginning, since I was with you. 5 But now I go away to [him] who sent me, and yet no man among you says to me: Where do you go away to? 6 But since I have spoken these things, grief has filled your heart. 7 But I am telling you the truth: It is beneficial for you that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Helper will by no means come to you, but if I go away, I will send him to you. 8 For when he shall come, he will make the world believe, concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgement: 9 concerning sin, since they do not believe in me; 10 concerning righteousness, since I am going away to the Father and they will not see me [any]more, 11 concerning judgement, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
	12 I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 13 But when he shall come, the Spirit of truth, he shall lead you into the whole truth, for he shall not speak out of [him]self, but [the things] that he hears he will speak, and he will make known to you [the things] that will come. 14 He will bring me glory, since he will receive out of my [things] and will make them known to you. 15 All the things that the Father has are mine. Because of that I said that he receives out of my [things] and makes them known to you. 16 After a short time you will not see me [any]more, and after another short time you will see me again.”
	17 Therefore some of his disciples said, one to the other: “What does this mean that he said to us: After a short time you will not see me [any]more, and after another short time you shall see me again, and: Because I go away to the Father – ?” 18 Thus they said: “What does this mean that he says: a short time? We do not understand what he is saying.” 19 Jesus knew that they wanted to inquire of him, and he said to them: “Are you inquiring among yourselves about this, because I said: After a short time you will not see me, and after another short time you will see me again – ? 20 Truly, truly I say to you: You will have tears and you will be wailing, but the world will be happy; but your grief will be changed into joy.  21 A woman, when she is bearing a baby, has grief, because her time has come; but when she has borne the child, she does not [any]more recall her tribulation, because of her joy that a man has been born into the world.  22 So you too have grief now. But I will see you again, and your heart shall have joy, and nobody will take your joy [away] from you. 23 For in that day you will not ask me about a single thing. Truly, truly I say to you: Everything that you pray for from the Father in my name he will give to you. 24 Until now you have not prayed for a single thing in my name. Pray and you shall receive, that your joy will be full. 
	25 These things I have spoken to you in comparisions. An hour is coming when I will no more speak to you in comparisons, but openly I will tell you about the Father. 26 In that time you will not ask a single thing in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask [anything] of the Father concerning you [, either]. 27 For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God. 28 I have come forth from the Father and have come into the world. Furthermore, I go away from the world and go to the Father.
	29 His disciples said: “Look! Now you are speaking openly, and you do not speak [any] comparison! 30 Now we know that you know all things and you do not have need that anyone inquires of you. By this we know that you came forth from God.” 31 Jesus answered them: “Now you believe? 32 Look! The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you shall be scattered everyone to his own house, and me you will leave [hehta- “forsake”] alone, and yet I am not alone, since the Father is with me. 33 I have spoken these things to you, that by me you will have peace. In this world you have tribulation, but have courage! I have conquered the world.” 
CHAPTER 17
Jesus said these things, and raising his eyes to heaven he said: “Father, the hour has come; bring glory to your Son, that your Son will bring glory to you, 2 since you have given him lordship over all flesh, that he will give eternal life to all that you have given him. 3 This is eternal life, that they know you, the sole true God, and [the one] whom you sent, Jesus Christ. 4 I have brought you glory on earth, completing the work that you have given me to do. 5 And now, Father, make me glorious beside you with the glory that I had beside you before the world existed!
	6 I have revealed your name to the men that you gave me out of the world. They were your own, and you gave them to me, and they have abided by your word. 7 Now they know that all things that you gave me are from you, 8 for the sayings that you gave me I have given to them, and they have received them and indeed they know that you sent me. 9 I make petition concerning them. I do not make petition concerning the world, but about [the ones] that you have given me, since they are yours, 10 and all my things are your own and your own ones are mine, and I have been made glorious among them.
	11 Furthermore, I am not [any]more in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them for [the sake of] your own name that you have given me, that they will be one, like us. 12 When I was with them I protected them for [the sake of] your own name, and I have kept them, and no man among them is destroyed except [he] who was going to be destroyed, to fulfill the scripture. 13 But now I am coming to you, and I say these things in the world that they will have full joy in themselves. 14 I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, since they are not a part of the world, as I am not a part of the world.
	15 I ask [pray, petition] of you, not that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from evil. 16 They are not a part of the world, as I am not a part of the world. 17 Sanctify them with truth; your word is truth. 18 As you sent me into the world, I too sent them into the world. 19 And I sanctify myself for them, that they will be sanctified with the truth.
	20 I pray, not concerning them alone, but also concerning those who believe in me by their word, 21 that they will all be one, as you, Father, is in me and I in you, that also they will be in us [vetse, dual locative], [so] that the world will believe that you sent me. 22 Therefore, the glory that you have given me I have given them, that they will be one, as we are [vet nát, dual] one, 23 I in them and you in me, that they will be made perfect into one, that the world will know that you sent me and that you loved them, as you loved me. 24 Father, I wish that where I am, also [the ones] that you have given me will be with me, that they will see my glory that you have given me, because you loved be before the world was established. 25 Just Father, the world does not know you, but I know you, and these people know that you sent me. 26 And I have made your name known to them and I will make it known again, [so] that the love with which you loved me will be in them, and I in them.
CHAPTER 18
After saying these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the brook called Kidron, to a place where [there] was a garden, and he and his disciples entered it. 2 But also Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, since Jesus at numerous times met with with his disciples there. 3 Therefore Judas took the soldier host and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees and came there, bringing torches and lamps and weapons. 4 Thus Jesus, knowing all the things going to come upon him, went forward and said to them: “What do you seek?” 5 They said: “Jesus from Nazareth.” He said to them: “I [am] he.” Also Judas, who betrayed him, stood among them.
	6 But when he said to them: “I [am] he,” they stood back and fell to the ground. 7 Therefore he answered them again: “Whom do you seek?” They said: “Jesus from Nazareth.” 8 Jesus answered: “I have said to you that I am he. Therefore, if [it is] me you seek, let them go away” 9 – in order to fulfill the word that he said: “Among [the ones] that you gave to me no man is lost to me.”
	10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the chief priest and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. 11 But Jesus said to Peter: “Put your sword in the sheath! The cup that the Father has given me, am I really not to drink it?”
	12 Then the soldier host and the centurion and the officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him. 13 They brought him first to Annas, for he was the father of the wife of Caiaphas, who was the chief priest in that year. 14 Caiaphas was [the one] who said to the Jews that it was beneficial for them that one man died on behalf of the people.
	15 But Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the chief priest and came with Jesus into the courtyard of the chief priest, 16 but Peter remained on the outside by the gate. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the chief priest, came out and spoke to [the one] who watched the gate and led Peter inside. 17 Then the maid who watched the gate said: “Are not you too of the disiples of that man?” He answered: “I am not.”
	18 The disciples and the officers had made a coal fire, for [it] was cold, and they stood warming themselves. Also Peter stood with them warming himself.
	19 Then the chief priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 20 Jesus answered him: “I have spoken to the world openly. Always I taught in synagogue and in the temple, where all Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret. 21 For what reason are you inquiring of me? Inquire of [those] who heard what I said to them. Look! They know what I said.” 22 After he said these things, one of the officers that stood by him beat Jesus in the face and said: “Are you answering the chief priest so?” 23 Jesus answered him: “If I say what is bad, witness about the badness, but if I said what is right, what is your reason for beating me?” 24 Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.
	25 Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Then he said to him: “Are not you too among his disciples?” He denied it and said: “I am not.” 26 Among the slaves of the chief priest [there] was one of the family of the man whose ear Peter cut off, and he said: “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” 27 But Peter denied it again, and in the same moment a cock crowed [lit. “sounded”, as in the Greek]. 
	28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the governor. Now [it] was early. But they did not enter the palace of the governor, in order not to become unclean, but they might eat the pascal meal. Then Pilate came outside to them and said: “What is the crime that you are saying this man has committed?” 30 They answered him: “If this man was not a criminal, we did not turn him over to you.” 31 Then Pilate said to them: “You take him and judge him by your law.” The Jews said to him: “We may not kill anyone” 32 – in order to fulfill the word that Jesus spoke to indicate the kind of death that he was to die.
	33 Therefore Pilate went into the palace of the governor and called Jesus and said to him: “Are you the king of [the] Jews?” 34 Jesus answered: “Do you say this by yourself, or have others talked to you about me?” 35 Pilate answered: “Surely I am not a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests gave you over to me. What have you done?” 36 Jesus answered: “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom was of this world, my servants would have fought, that I would [Q: will] not be given over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.”
	37 Therefore Pilate said to him: “Thus you are a king?” Jesus answered: “You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this thing I have been born, and for this thing I have come into the world, that I am to witness about the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.” 38 Pilate said to him: “What is truth?”
	After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them: “I do not find [any] guilt in him. 39 But you have a custom that I release to you a man at the Passover. Do you wish, then, that I release to you the king of [the] Jews?” 40 Then they cried again, saying: “Not this man, but Barabbas!” But Barabbas was a robber. 
CHAPTER 19
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and flogged him. 2 And the soldiers made a crown of some thorns and put it on his head and threw a violet raiment around him, 3 and they came before him and said: “Hail, King of [the] Jews.” And they beat him in the face. 4 And Pilate went out again and said to them: “Look! I am bringing him out to you again, that you can know that I do not find [any] guilt in him.” 5 Therefore Jesus came out, bearing the crown of thorns and the violet raiment. And he said to them: “Behold the man!” 6 But when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried [out] saying: “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them: “You take him and crucify him, for I do not find [any] guilt in him.” 7 The Jews answered him: “We have a law, and by that law he is worthy of death, since he has made [him]self God’s son.”
8 Therefore, when Pilate heard this saying, he was more frightened, 9 and he went into the palace again and said to Jesus: “Where do you come from?” But Jesus did not give him [any] answer. 10 Therefore Pilate said to him: “Do you not talk to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?” 11 Jesus answered him: “You had no authority at all over me if it was not given you from on high. Because of this the man who turned me over to you has greater [ambe túra = more great] sin.”
	12 Therefore Pilate sought a way of releasing him. But the Jews shouted, saying: “If you relase this man, you are not a friend of the High King [or, Emperor]! Anyone who makes [him]self a king rises up against the High King!” 13 Therefore Pilate, after hearing these things, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on his judge[ment] seat in a place called the Stone Court, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. 14 Now [it] was the preparation of the Passover; [it] was around the night hour. And he said to the Jews: “Behold your king!” 15 But they cried: “Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them: “Am I to crucify your king?” The chief priests answered: “We do not have [any] king except the High King!” 16 Then, therefore, he gave Jesus over to them for crucifixion.
	So they took Jesus. 17 Carrying his cross for [him]self he went out to the place called Skull Place, the Hebrew name of which is Golgotha. 18 There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on his right and one on his left, with Jesus in the middle. 19 Pilate wrote also a sign and put it on the cross. [It] was written: “Jesus from Nazareth, King of [the] Jews.” 20 Thus many of the Jews read this sign, since the place where Jesus was crucified lay near to the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin and in Greek. 21 But the chief priests of [the] Jews said to Pilate: “Do not write: King of [the] Jews, but that he said: I am King of [the] Jews.” 22 Pilate answered: “What I have written I have written.”
	23 The soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his raiments and made four pieces, one piece for each soldier, and they took also his tunic. But the tunic was without [any] seam [yanwe “joining”], woven as a single piece from top to bottom. 24 Therefore they said, one to the other: “Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots about who will have it” – in order to fulfill the scripture that says: “They parted my robes among themselves, and about my tunic they cast lots.” And the soldiers indeed did so.
	25 [There] stood beside Jesus’ cross his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the mother of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 Thus, when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple that he loved standing there, he said to his mother: “Woman, behold your son!” 27 Then he said to the disciple: “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own house.
	 28 Thereafter, when Jesus saw that everything was [Q: is] completed, he said in order to fulfill the scripture: “I am thirsty.” 29 [There] was there a bowl full of sour wine, and they put a sponge on a spear and brought it to his mouth. 30 After receiving the sour wine, Jesus said: “It is completed!”, and he let his head drop and expired.
	31 Since this happened on the day of Preparation, the Jews requested from Pilate that their legs were to be [Q: will be] broken and the bodies taken away, that they would not remain on the cross on the day of rest, for that day of rest was great. 32 Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and the other who [*yet, dual] were crucified with him. 33 But coming to Jesus they saw that he was [Q: is] dead already and did not break his legs. 34 And yet one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and in the same moment blood and water came out. 35 And [he] who has seen it has witnessed, and his witness is true, and he knows that he is telling true things, that also you will believe. 36 For these things happened to fulfull the scripture: “A single bone of his body will not be broken.” 37 And again, a different scripture says: “They will look at [him] whom they have pierced.”
	38 After these things Joseph from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but in secred for fear of the Jews, made request from Pilate to take away Jesus’ body, and Pilate allowed it. Therefore he came and took his body away. 39 Also Nicodemus, the man who came to him at night in the beginning, came bringing a blend of fragrant resin and eaglewood [a.k.a. aloe], around a hundred pounds. 40 Thus they [-tte, dual] took Jesus’ body and wrapped it in wraps with the fragrant herbs, according to [the] Jews’ custom when they prepare a corpse for the grave. 41 But in the place where he was crucified [there] was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which nobody was yet put [/where nobody had yet been put]. 42 Therefore they put Jesus’ body there, since that was [the] Jews’ day of Preparation, and since the tomb was near.
CHAPTER 20
On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, when [it] was still dark, and she saw that the rock was [Q; is] taken away from the tomb. 3 Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them: “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put him.” 3 Then Peter went forth with the other disciple, and they [-tte, dual] went to the tomb. 4 Both men ran, but the other other disciple ran faster than Peter and came first to the tomb, 5 and he bent and saw the clothes lying there, but he did not enter. 6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and he entered the tomb. He saw the wraps lying there, 7 and the cloth that was on his head, not lying with the wraps, but rolled up in a separate place. 8 Then the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, also entered; and he saw and he believed. 9 For still they did not know the scripture, that [it] was necessary for him to rise from [the] dead. 10 Then the disciples returned to their [-tta, dual] homes.
11 But Mary stood in tears by the tomb. And while her tears poured she bent to look into the tomb, 12 and she saw two angels in white sit [there], one by the head and one by the feet where Jesus’ body had been lying. 13 They [-tte, dual] said to her: “Woman, what is the reason for your tears?” She said to them: “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him.” 14 Saying this, she turned and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that he was [Q: is] Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her: “Woman, what is the reason for your weeping? Whom do you seek?” Supposing that he was the gardener, she said to him: “Lord, if you have carried him away, tell me the place where you have put him, and I will take him away.” 16 Jesus said to her: “Mary!” Turning, she said to him in Hebrew: “Rabboni” – which means teacher. 17 Jesus said to her: “Do not touch me, for I have not yet risen up to my Father. But go to my brothers and say to them: I ascend to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.” Mary Magdalene came and brought the news to the disciples: “I have seen the Lord!”, and that he said these things to her. 
	19 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors were closed where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them: “Peace be to you!” 20 After saying this she showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were happy when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus repeated to them: “Peace be to you!  As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” 22 And after saying this he breathed on them and said to them: “Receive the Holy Spirit! 23 If you forgive peoples’ sins, they are forgiven them; if you retain [tulca- “establish”] peoples’ sins, they are retained.”
	24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 Thus the other disciples said to him: “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them: “If I will not see in his hands the marks of the nails, and I do not put my hand in his side, I will not believe.”
	26 Eight days after this his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, but Jesus came to them and said: “Peace be to you!” 27 Then he said to Thomas: “Put your finger here, and see my hands, and send your hand, and put it in my side; do not be without belief, but believing.” 28 Thomas answered him: “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus said to him: “Do you believe because of seeing me? Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe.”
	30 Jesus did also many other signs before the disciples, that are not written in this book; 31 but these are written that you will believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you will have life by his name.
CHAPTER 21
After these things Jesus revealed himself to the disciples by the Sea [of] Tiberias; and he revealed himself thus: 2 [There] were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called the Twin, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples. 3 Simon Peter said to them: “I am going to catch some fishes.” They said to him: “We too are coming with you.” They went out and went into the boat, but through[out] that night they caught nothing.
	4 But when morning came, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not understand that he was Jesus. 5 Then Jesus said to them: “My children, have you not got [any] fishes?” They said to him: “We have not.” 6 He said to them: “Throw the net at the right of the boat and you will find some fishes!” So they threw it, and then they could not draw it up for the multitude of fishes. 7 Therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: “He is the Lord!” Thus Simon Peter, hearing that he was the Lord, bound his jacket around his waist, for he was naked, and threw himself into the sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the boat – for they were not far from land, only around a hundred yards – drawing the net of fishes.
	9 But when they stood off onto land they saw a coal fire lie there and some fishes lying on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them: “Bring some fishes of those you caught now.” 11 Therefore Simon Peter went into the boat and drew the net ashore [nórenna, “to land”], full of a hundred and fifty-three huge fishes. But though they were that many, the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them: “Come, have breakfast!” No man of the disciples dared to ask him: “Who are you?”, since they knew that he was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and also the fishes. 14 This was the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disiciples after he was raised from [the] dead.
	15 When they had eaten the breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Simon son of John, do you love me more than them?” Peter said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me.” He said to him: “Give food to my lambs.” 16 Again he said to him, a second time: “Simon Peter, do you love me?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me.” He said to him: “Be a shepherd for my sheep!”
	17 He said to him a third time: “Simon son of John, am I dear to you?” Peter had grief because he said to him a third time: “Am I dear to you?” Thus he said to him: “Lord, you know everything; you know that you are dar to me!” Jesus said to him: “Give food to my lambs. 18 Truly, truly I say to you: When you were younger, you bound the belt about yourself and walked where you wished. But when you shall be old, you will reach [out] with your hands and another will bind you and lead you where you do not wish.” 19 This he said to show the kind of death by which he was going to bring glory to God. And after this he said to him: “Follow me.”
	20 When he turned [Q: turned himself], Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus loved follow – the person who at the evening meal was leaning towards his chest and said: “Lord, who is [the one] who betrays you?” 21 Therefore, when Peter saw him, he said to Jesus: “Lord, what will this man do?” 22 Jesus said to him: “If my will is that he will remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!” 23 Therefore this saying went out among the disciples: “That disciple will not die.” But Jesus did not say to him that he will not die, but: “If my will is that he will remain until I come, what is that to you?”
	24 He is the disciple who witnesses about this and who has written these things, and we know that his witness is true. 25 But [there] are also many other things that Jesus has done. If one were to write about every single matter, I suppose that there is not enough place [or, space] in the world itself for the books being written.
