CHAPTER 1
Since numerous ones have taken into hand to compose an account about the things that have happened among us, 2 as we received them from [those] who first were witnesses and servants of the word, 3 it seemed good also to me, after closely following all things from the beginning, to write them as chronological account for you, glorious Theophilus, 4 for you to know the firm foundation of the things about which you have been instructed.
	5 In the days of Herod, king of Judea, [there] was a priest called Zechariah, of the division of Abiah, and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and laws in a perfect manner. 7 But [there] was not [any] child with them, for Elizabeth could not conceive, and both had [an age of] many years.
	8 The turn [lú: occasion] came to his division, and he did the priest's work before God. 9 By throwing lots, as the custom of the priests was, it fell upon him to go into God's santuary to burn incence.  10 And the entire multitude of the people were standing praying on the outside at the hour of burning incence. 
	11 Then the Lord's angel showed himself to him, standing at the right of the altar of incence. 12 But Zechariah was troubled at seeing him, and fear fell upon him. 13 But the angel said to him: “Do not fear, Zechariah, for your petition has been heard, and Elizabeth your wife will be mother to a son to you, and you are to give him the name John. 14 And you will have joy and happiness, and numerous ones will be happy since he has been born,
15 for he will be great before the Lord, and wine and strong drink he is not to drink, and he will be filled with Holy Spirit all the way [aqua = wholly] from his mother's womb. 16 And numerous ones of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God, 17 and he will go before him in Elijah's spirit and power, to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the refusers to the insight of just ones, to put before the Lord a prepared people.”
	18 And Zechariah said to the angel: “How can I know this thing? For I am old, and my wife has [an age of] many years.” 19 In answer the angel said to him: “I [am] Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent forth to speak with you and to make known to you the good news about these things. 20 But behold! you will be silent and will not be able to speak until the day when these things will happen, since you did not believe in my words, which will be made real in their time.”
21 And the people waited for Zechariah, and they were in wonder since he was so long in the sanctuary. 22 But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he saw a vision in the sanctuary, and he made gestures to them, still being dumb. 23 When the days of his service were complete, he went away to his house.
	24 But after these days Elizabeth conceived, and she secluded herself from others for [ter = 'through'] six months, saying: “Thus the Lord has done to me, in the days in which he heeded me to take away my humiliation among men.”
	26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, 27 to a maiden pledged for marriage with a man called Joseph, of the kin of David, and the maiden's name was Mary.
	28 And when the angel entered before her, he said: “Greetings, you who have received grace; the Lord [is] with you. 29 But Mary was troubled by the saying and tried to understand what kind of greeting that was. 30 And the angel said to her: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God, 31 and behold! you will conceive in your womb and will bear a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, for the Lord God will give him David his father's throne, 32 and he will rule over Jacob's house [nosse: kin] forever, and [there] will not be [any] end of his kingdom.”
	34 But Mary said to the angel: “How will this thing happen, since I do not know a man?” 35 And in answer the angel said to her: “Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; thus also the holy [one] being born will be called God's Son.
36 And behold! Elizabeth, who is of your kin, has herself conceived a son in her old age, and this month is the sixth for her who was called unfruitful. 37 For to God [there] is nothing impossible.” 38 Then Mary said: “Behold the servant-girl of the Lord! May it happen to me as you have said.” And the angel went away from her.
	39 But in those days Mary arose and went with urgency to a city in Judea, 40 and she went into the hpise of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. 41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe in her womb jumped, and Elizabeth was filled with Holy Spirit, 42 and she cried with a great voice and said: “Blessed [are] you among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of your womb! 43 And how is [it] that this thing has happened to me, that my Lord's mother is coming to me?” 44 And behold! when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb jumped with great joy! 45 Happy [is] she who believed that will be made true the things spoken to her by the Lord!”
46 Then Mary said: “My soul praises the Lord, 47 and my spirit is in joy by God my Savior, 48 for he has seen the lowly state of his maidservant. And behold! from now all generations will call me happy, 49 for the Mighty One has done great deeds to me, and holy is his name; 50 and through generations and generations his mercy is upon [those] that love him. 51 He has done mighty things,  he has scattered [those] that are haughty in the thoughts of their hearts. 52 He threw down mighty ones from thrones and raised up lowly ones; 53 he has filled the hungry ones with good things and has sent away empty [those] that had riches. 54 He has helped Israel his servant, to recall mercy,55 as he told to our fathers, to Abraham and to his kin, forever. 56 And Mary remained with Elizabeth around three months. Then she returned to her house.
	57 For Elizabeth came the time for bearing her baby, and she bore a son. 58 And the neighbors and the people of her kin heard that the Lord gave her great mercy, and they were in joy with her. 59 And on the eight day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call it by his father's name, Zecharia. 60 But its mother answered and said: “No, but its name shall be John.” 61 Then they said to her: “[There] is no man in your family that has that name.” 62 Then they sought an answer from the father by gestures, what name he wanted for the child. 63 And he requested a tablet and wrote: “His name is John.” And all among them marveled.
At the same moment his mouth was opened and his tongue loosened, and he spoke, blessing God. 65 And fear fell upon all his neighbors, and in the whole mountain-region in Judea one talked about all these things, 65 and all that heard perceived it in their heart, saying: “What indeed will this child be?” For also the Lord's hand was with him.
	67 And Zecharia his father was filled with Holy Spirit and spoke as a prophet, saying: 68 “Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, since he has heeded and has delivered his people! 29 And he raised for us a horn of salvation in David his servant's house, 70 as he has spoken through the mouth of his holy heralds from out of the past, 71 about salvation from our enemies and from the hand of [those] that hate us, 72 to show mercy on our fathers and to recall his holy covenant, 73 the oath that he gave to Abraham our father,
74 to allow us to be servants for him after we were saved from the hand of our enemies, 75 in holiness and justness before him in all our days. 76 But you, child, shall be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by forgiveness of their sins, 78 by our God's compassion of mercy, by which a sunrise out of high will come upon us, 79 in order to give glory to [those] that sit in darkness and death-shadow, to lead our feet on the path of peace.”
	80 And the child grew and was made mighty in spirit, and he was in the deserts until the day when he was going to show himself to Israel.
CHAPTER 2
And it happened [lit. ”came”] in those days that a command went forth from Augustus the High King to count the whole world. 2 This first counting occurred while Qurinius was ruler of Syria. 3 All people went in order to be counted, everyone to his own city. 4 Also Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the city [of] Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of David’s house and family, 5 in order to be counted [along] with Mary who was to be given to him in marriage, and who now was with child. 6 While they [-ttë, dual] were there, the time came when [yasse = in which] she was to bear her baby. 7 And she bore her son, the firstborn, and swaddled him and put him in a manger [*salquecolca = grass-box], since [there] was not [any] room for them [tún, dual] at the inn.
	8 [There] were some shepherds [mavalli  = mavar-li, partitive plural] in that same country that dwelt in the field, watching their flocks in the night. 9 And the Lord’s angel stood by them, and the Lord’s glory shone about [*os] them, and great fear seized them. 10 But the angel said to them: ”Do not be afraid, for I am making known to you a great joy that will be for the entire people, 11 for [there] has been born to you today a Saviour, who is Christ, the Lord, in the city of David. 12 And this will be for you a sign: You will find an infant, swaddled and lying in a manger.” 13 And suddenly [rincanen = with a sudden move] [there] was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying: 14 “Glory be in the high places to God, and on earth peace to the men of whom he thinks well.”
	15 And after the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to the other: ”Let us go to Bethlehem to see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” 16 And they went with urgency and found Mary and Joseph and the infant lying in the manger. 17 When they saw him, they made known the things that were said to them about this child. 18 And wonder seized everyone hearing about the things told to them by the shepherds, 19 but Mary kept these sayings and thought about them in her heart. 20 Then the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God about everything that they had heard and seen, wholly as that had been told to them.
21 And when the eighth day came, for him to be circumcised, he received the name Jesus, with which the angel called him before he was conceived in the womb.
	22 When the days of purification were completed by the Law of Moses, they [dual] brought him to Jerusalem to place him before [= present him to] the Lord, 23 as is written in the Law of the Lord: “Every male opening a womb will be called holy to the Lord”, 24 and to bring a sacrifice as is written in the Law of the Lord: “Two turtledoves or two young doves.”
	25 And behold! [there] was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and fearing God, waiting for the comfort of Israel, and holy spirit lay upon him. 
36 Furthermore, it was revealed to him that he was not going to [Q: will not] see death before seeing the Christ of the Lord. 27 By the Spirit he now came to the temple, and when the parents [dual] brought the child Jesus to do to him what was usual by the Law, 28 Simeon himself received him into his arms, and he praised God and said: “Now, Master, you will allow your servant to pass away in peace as you have said, 30 for my eyes have seen your salvation, 31 that you have prepared before all the peoples, 32 a light to take away the veil from the nations and a glory to Israel your people. 33 And his father and his mother were [dual] were in wonder about the things said about him. 34 And Simeon blessed them, but he said to Mary his mother: “Behold, this one has been placed for the fall and for the rising of numeous ones in Israel, and a sign that one speaks against 35 – indeed a sword will go through your own soul – to reveal the thoughts of numerous hearts.”
	36 And [there] was a woman called Anna, daughter of Fanuel of the tribe [or kin] of Asher, who was a prophet. She was old and had [an age of] many years, after she dwelt with a man for [ter, through] seven years after her virginhood, 37 and thereafter she was widowed until she now had [an age of] eighty-four years. She was not ever away from the temple, but she served God day and night, keeping fasts and calling upon him. 38 And in that hour she arose and gave thanks to God, and she talked about the child to all that looked forward to the deliverance of Jerusalem.
	39 And after they [dual – the parents] completed everything by the Law of the Lord they returned to Galilee and their city, Nazareth. 40 And the child grew [or thrived] and started to be strong, being filled with wisdom, and grace rested on him.
41 Every year his parents [dual] went to Jerusalem, to the festival of Passover. 42 And when he had [an age of] twelve years, they [pl.] went according to [-nen] the tradition of the festival 42 and completed the days. But when they [dual = the parents] returned, Jesus the boy remained in Jerusalem, and his parents did not notice it. 44 Supposing that he was [Q: is] among the people traveling together, they went a distance of one day; then they sought him among their relatives and the people that they knew. 45 But when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him. 46 And after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them. 47 But all that listened to him were startled by [-nen] his understanding and by his answers. 48 Now when they [dual = the parents] saw him they were in wonder, and his mother said to him: “Child, what is your reason for doing so to us? Behold, your father and I were tormented, seeking you!” 49 But he said to them: “What is your reason for seeking me? Did you not know that it is necessary for me to be in the house of my Father?” 50 But they did not understand the saying that he said to them.
51 And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he heeded their commands. And his mother kept all these things in her heart. 52 And Jesus went forward in wisdom and growth and grace among God and men.
CHAPTER 3
In the fifteenth year in which Tiberius ruled as High King [or, Emperor], when Pontius Pilate was governor [nórecáno: land-commander], and Herod ruled as farthing-ruler in Galilee, and Philip his brother ruled as farthing-ruler in the regions [of] Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysenias was the farthing-ruler of Abilene, 2 while Annas and Caiaphas were chief priests, God's word came to John, Zechariah's son, in the wilderness.
	3 And he went to the entire region around Jordan, making known baptism of repentance which gives forgivenes of sins, 4 as is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the Prophet: ”A voice that is crying in the wilderness: You prepare the Lord's way, make his paths straight! 5 Every gully will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be made flat, and the bends will be made straight paths and the humps smooth roads, 6 and all flesh will see God's salvation.”
	7 Therefore he said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him: ”Children of serpents, who has told you how to escape from the coming wrath? 8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves: 'As father we have Abraham.' For I say to you that God can rise [up] children to Abraham from these stones. 9 Indeed the axe even now lies by the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not make good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” 
	10 And the crowds asked him: ”Then what are we to do?” 11 In answer he said to them: “It is necessary for the man who has two tunics, to give one to the person that does not have, and it is necessary for [him] who has things to eat to do the same.”
12 But also tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him: “Teacher, what are we to do?” 13 He said to them: “Do not demand money beyond the proper sum.” 14 Furthermore, [those] who worked in the army asked him: “What are we to do?” And he said to them: “Do not harass anyone, and do not speak lies about crimes that people have not committed, but let your payment suffice for you.”
	15 Now the entire people looked forward to what would happen, and all thought in their heart about John: “Perhaps he is the Christ?” 16 John answered them: “I baptize you with water; but [there] comes [the one] who is stronger than I; I am not worthy to loose the strap of his shoes [dual]. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and with fire. 17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to cleanse his threshing floor, and he will gather his grain into the store, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that no one can extinguish.”
18 Therefore he gave also many other urgings and made the gospel known to the people. 19 But Herod the farthing-ruler, when he was rebuked by him concerning Herodias his brother's wife and concerning the wicked deeds that Herod did, 20 added also this thing to all those deeds: he put John in prison.
	21 Now when the whole people was baptized, also Jesus was baptized, and as he prayed, heaven was opened 22 and the Holy Spirit, in body-shape of a dove, came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: “You are my son, the beloved; with you I am pleased.” 
22 And Jesus himself, at the beginning of his labor, had [an age of] around thirty years. He was, one supposed, son of Joseph, son of Heli, 24 son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai, son of Joseph, 25 son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai, 26 son of Maath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josech, son of Joda, 
27 son of Joanan, son of Rhesa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri, 28 son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er, 29 son of Jesus, son of Eliezer, son of Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi, 30 son of Symeon, son of Judas, son of Josef, son of Jonam, son of Eliakim, 31 son of Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David, 32 son of Jesse, son of Odeb, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon, 33 son of Amminadab, son of Arni, son of Hezron, 34 son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor, 35 son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah, 36 son of Cainan, son of Arpachshad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech, 37 son of Methuselah, so of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahallaleel, son of Cainan, 38 son of Enosh, son of Set, son of Adam, God's son.
And Jesus, full of Holy Sprit, went away from Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the desert 2 for forty days, being tempted by the Devil. And he ate nothing in those days, and when they were gone, he was hungry. 3 Then the Devil said to him: “If you are God's son, say to this stone: Become bread!” 4 But Jesus answered him: “[It] is written: Man shall not have life by bread alone.” 
	5 Then he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of [the] world in a single moment, 6 and the Devil said to him: “I shall give you all this power and their glory, for it has been given to me, and I will give it to anyone that I wish. 7 Therefore, if you give worship to me, everything shall be your own.” 8 In answer Jesus said to him: “[It] is written: To the Lord your God you are to give worship, and to him alone you are to be a servant.”
	9 Now he led him into Jerusalem and put him on the wing of the temple and said to him: “If you are God's son, throw yourself down from here, for [it] is written: He will command his angels concerning you, for them to keep you, 21 and: They will carry you on their hands, to stop you from striking your foot against [any] stone.” 12 In answer Jesus said to him: “It is said: Do not test the Lord your God.” 13 Then the Devil, having completed the entire temptation, went away from him until another time.
	14 Now Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. And good talk about him spread throughout the entire surrounding country. 15 And he taught in their synagogues, receiving praise from all.
	16 And he came to Nazareth, where he was raised, and as his habit was he entered the synagogue, and he arose to read.
17 Then the scroll [tolu-parma 'roll-book'] of Isaiah the Prophet was given to him, and he opened the book and found the place where [it] was written: 18 “The spirit of the Lord is on me, for he annointed me to give good news to poor ones; he sent me to make known to people in prison that they will be freed and to blind ones that they will receive sight, to send the broken ones away by a release, 19 to make known the Lord's year of good will.” 20 And he rolled up the book, gave it back to the servant and sat down; and the eyes of all that were in the synagogue were fixed on him. 21 Then he began to say to them: “Today this scripture has been made true while you heard it.”
	22 And all witenssed about him, and they were in wonder about the gracious words that came out of his mouth, and they said: “Is this man not Joseph's son?”
23 Then he said to them: “Indeed you want to say to me this proverb: Healer, heal yourself! The things that we have heard happened in Capernaum, do them also here in your own region!” 24 But he said: “Truly I say to you that there is not [any] prophet that is well received in his own region. 25 For in truth I say to you: There were numerous widows in Israel in the days of Eliah, when heaven was shut for [ter, “through”] three years and six months, causing a great famine to fall upon the land; 26 and yet Eliah was not sent to anyone among them, but to Zarephath in the land of Sidon, to a widowed woman there. 27 Furthermore, [there] were numerous skin-diseased ones in Israel at the time of Elisha the prophet, and yet no one among them was cleansed, but Naaman from Syria.” 28 And all that heard these things in the synagogue were filled with rage, 29 and they arose and hurried him to the outside of the city, and their led him to the brow of the mountain on which their city was built, to throw him down from there. 30 But he walked through their midst and went away. 
31 And he went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. And he taught them on the day of rest, 31 and they were filled with wonder by the manner that he taught, for his speech had power. 33 And [there] was in the synagoge a man possessed by a spirit, an unclean demon, and it cried with a mighty voice: 34 “Ah! What [is] there to us and to you [= what do you have to do with our matters], Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God!” 35 And Jesus rebuked it, saying: “Be silent and come out of him!” And after throwing the man down in their midst, the demon  came out of him, without hurting him. 36 Then wonder fell upon all, and they talked one with the other, saying: “What kind of speech is this? For with power and with might he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” 37 And the news about him went out in every place in the surrounding country.
	38 After leaving the synagoge he went into the house of Simon. But Simon's wife's mother was troubled by a great fever [úre, 'heat'], and they made petition to him about her.
39 And he stood above the woman and rebuked the fever, and that went away from her. In the same moment she arose and served for them. 
	40 But at the setting of the sun, all that had people sick with illnesses of this or that kind  brought them to him. By putting his hands on them he healed them. 41 Furthermore, demons came out from numerous ones, crying and saying: “You are God's son.” But he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak, since they knew that he was [Q: is] the Christ.
	42 But when day came, he went out and went to a lonely place. But the crowds sought him, and they came to where he was, and they tried to stop him from going away from them. 43 But he said to them: “Also to the other cities it is necessary for me to make known the gospel, for that is the reason why [yanen = by which] I was sent forth.” 44 And he went making the message known in the synagogues of Judea.
CHAPTER 5
At an occasion when the crowd pressed against him, listening to God's word, he stood by the lake [of] Gennesaret. 2 And he saw two boats lying [on the shore] by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them [dual] and were washing their nets. 3 Going into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to go a short distance [tie = path, direction] from the land. Then he sat down, and from the boat he taught the crowds.
	When he ceased to speak, he said to Simon: “Go to where it is deep, and you [pl.] put down your nets for a catch.” 5 But in answer Simon said: “Teacher, throughout the entire night we have toiled and caught nothing, but at [-nen] your order I will put the nets down.”
	6 When they did so, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their nets were being torn. 7 And they gestured to their partners in the other boat for them to come to help them, and they came, and they filled both boats, until they [dual] were sinking,
8 When he saw that, Simon Peter fell down before Jesus' knees, saying: “Go away from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord!” 9 For by the catch of fishes he was struck with wonder, he and all that were with him, 10 and also both Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, that were partners with Simon. But Jesus said to Simon: “Do not be afraid! From now you will catch men alive.” 11 And they brought the boats to land and abandoned everything and followed him.
	12 And when he was in one of the cities, behold! a man full of skin-disease. When he saw Jesus he fell upon his face and begged of him, saying: “Lord, if you want to, you can cleanse me!” 13 And reaching out with his hand Jesus touched him, saying: “I want to! Be cleansed!” And in the same moment the skin-disease disappeared from him. 14 And he commanded the man: “Tell nobody, but go away and show yourself to the priest, and as Moses commended made a sacrifice for your cleansing, as a witness to them.” 15 But the word about him scattered that much more, and great crowds came together to listen and to be healed from their sicknesses. 16 But he went away into the deserts, praying.
	17 It happened in a day that he was teaching, and some Pharisees and teachers of the Law that had come from every village of Galilee and of Judea and of Jerusalem sat there, and the Lord's power was there, for him to be able to heal. 18 And behold! some people came carrying on a bed a man that was lame, and they sought to bring him forward and put him before Jesus. 19 But when they did not find how they could carry him forward, by reason of the crowd, they climbed to the roof, and through the thatch they lowered him down with the bed, in the middle before Jesus. 20 And when he saw their faith he said: “Man, your sins are forgiven you!”
21 And the scribes an the Pharisees started to think, saying: “Who is this man that is speaking blasphemies? Who may forgive sins except God alone?” 22 But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said in answer to them: “About what are you thinking in your hearts? 23 What is the [thing] more easily done, saying 'Your sins are forgiven to you' or saying: “Rise, take your bed and go to your house.' 24 But for you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins” – he said to the lame man: “I say to you, rise and take up your bed and go to your house.” 25 And in the same moment he arose before them, took up that on which he lay, and went to his house giving glory to God. 26 Then all among them were beside themselves, and they gave glory to God and were filled with fear, saying: “We have seen wonders today!”
	27 And after these things he went forth and saw a tax-collector called Levi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Follow me.” 28 And abandoning everything he arose and followed him. 29 Furthermore, Levi made a great feast for him at his house, and [there] was a great crowd, tax collectors and others, that were with them at the table. 30 And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled against his disciples, saying: “How is [it] that you eat and you drink with tax collectors and sinners?” 31 In answer Jesus said to them: “[Those] that have health do not have need of a healer, but [those] that are sickly. 32 I have come to call, not just ones, but sinners to repentence.”
	33 They said to him: “John's disciples frequently keep fast and make supplications, but your own eat and drink.” 34 Jesus said to them: “Surely you cannot compel the bridegroom's friends to keep a fast fast while the bridegroom is with them? And yet days shall come in which the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they shall keep fast, in those days.”
	36 Furthermore, he spoke this comparison: “No one cuts a cloth-piece from a new cloak and sews it in an old cloak, but if one indeed does so, then the new cloth-piece tears away; furthermore, the cloth-piece from the new cloak is not similar to [= does not match] the old. 37 And no one puts new wine in old skin-bottles, but if one indeed does so, then the new wine bursts the skin-bottles, and it flows out and the skin-bottles are destroyed. 38 But it is necessary to put new wine in new skin-bottles! 39 No one who has drunk old wine wants new, for he says: 'The old is good.'”
CHAPTER 6
It happened [lit. came] on a day of restthat he went through some grain-fields [ori-resta-li], and his disciples picked and ate the heads of grain, crushing them in their hand. 2 But some of the Pharisees said: “How is [it] that you are doing what is not allowed on the day of rest?” 
	3 But Jesus answered them: “Have you not ever read about that which David did when he and the men with him were hungry? 4 He went into God's house and received the breads of presentation [taníeva = of showing] and ate and gave them to the men with him, though they are not permitted food for anyone except for the priests alone.” 5 And he said to them: “The Son of Man is Lord of the day of rest.”
	6 It happened [lit. came] on another day of rest taht he went into the synagogue and taught. And [there] was there a man whose right hand was withered. 7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching him, to see if he was going to heal anyone on the day of rest, for them to find a way [lé] with which they could accuse him. 8 But he knew how they thought, and yet he said to the man having the withered hand: “Rise and stand in the middle.” And he arose and stood there. 9 Then Jesus said to them: “I ask of you: Is it allowed on the day of rest to do good or to do evil, to save a person or to destroy him?”
10 And after he looked at all among them, from person to person, he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” He did so, and his hand was healed. 11 But they were filled with rage, and spoke about what they were going to do to Jesus.
	12 It happened [lit. 'came'] in those days that he went up into the mountain to pray, and he remained there through the night, in prayer to God 13 But when day came, he summoned his disciples and chose from among them twelve, that he also named apostles: 14 Simon, whom he also called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and Jacob and John, and Phillip and Bartholomew 15 and Matthew and Thomas and Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who is called the Zealot, 16 and Judah son of Jacob, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
	17 And he came down with them and stood on a plain, and [there] was a multitude of people from all of Judea and Jerusalemn and from the sea-regions arbout Tyre and Sidon, that came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. 18 Also [those] that were tormented by unclean spirits were being healed. 19 And the whole crowd sought to touch him, for power went out of him and healed all among them.
	20 And he raised his eyes towards his disciples and said: “Happy are the poor, for God's kingdom is yours!
	21 Happy are you that are hungry now, for you will be filled!
	Happy are you that are wailing, for you will laugh!
	22 Happy you are when men hate you, and when they turn from you and abuse you and throw out your name as evil, for the good of the Son of Man. 23 Have joy in that day and leap, for behold! your reward is great in heaven. For those are the same things that their fathers did to the prophets.
24 But woe to you that are rich, for you have received your entire comfort!
25 Woe to you that are full now, for you will be hungry!
Woe to you that laugh now, for you will have grief and tears!
26 Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for in the same manner their fathers spoke about the false prophets!
27 But I say to you that listen: Love your enemies and do well to [those] that hate you, 28 bless [those] that curse you and pray for [those] who speak evil about you. 29 Towards [the one] that strikes you on one chin turn also the other, and [the one] that takes your cloak do not stop from taking also the tunic.
30 Give to all that ask of you [sg], and from [the one] that takes your things, do not ask to receive them back.
	31 And as you [pl.] wish that men will do to you, so do to them.
	32 And if you love [those] that love you, how will that be beneficial for you? For also the sinners love [those] that love them. 33 And if you do good to [those] that do good to you, how will that be beneficial for you? Also the sinners do the same. 34 And if you lend to people from whom you have hope of receiving, how will that be beneficial to you? Also sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same sum. 35 On the contrary, love your enemies and do good and lend to others, without hope of receiving back, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to [those] who do not give thanks and to the evil ones. 36 Show mercy like your Father shows mercy!
37 Furthermore, do not judge, and you will by no means be judged; do not say that others are worthy of punishment, and [it] will not be said about you that you are worthy of punishment. Release, and you will be released. 38 Give, and one will give to you. A good measure – pressed down, shaken and abundant – they will place in your bosom. For by the measure with which you measure out, they will measure out to you.
	39 Then he also spoke this comparison: “Surely a blind person cannot lead a blind person? Will not both fall into a hollow? 40 [He] who learns is not above [the one] who instructs, but everyone that has been fully instructed will be like [the one] who instructs. 41 How is [it], then, that you look at the straw which is in your brother's eye, but you do not heed the plank which is in your own eye? 42 How is it possible for you to say to your brother: 'Brother, allow me to take the straw out of your eye,' when you do not look at the plank in your own eye?
43 For [there] does not exist [any] good tree producing foul fruit; again [there] does not exist [any] foul tree producing good fruit. 44 For every tree is known by its fruit. For people do not gather figs from thorns; furthermore, they do not cut grapes from a thorn-bush. 45 A good man brings good out of his heart's hidden treasure, but an evil man brings evil out of his evil treasure, for out of the heart's abundance his mouth speaks.
	46 How is [it] that you call me 'Lord, Lord', and yet you do not do the things that I say? 47 Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them – I will show you with whom one can compare him: 48 He is like a person building a house, who dug and put the foundation upon the rock. Therefore, when [there] was flood, the river beat against that house, but it could not shake it, since it was well built.
	49 But [the one] who has heard and does not do, is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. Against that the river beat, and in that same moment it collapsed, and the collapse of that house was great.”
CHAPTER 7
After he completed all his sayings while the people listened, he went into Capernaum. 2 But the slave of a centurion, who was dear to him, was ailing and near to expiring. 3 When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him some elders of the Jews to request him to come and to deliver his slave. 4 Then [those] that came to Jesus made petition of him and said: “He is worthy that you do this thing for him, 5 for he loves our nation, and he built for us the synagoge.” 6 And Jesus went with them. But when he was not far from the house, the centurion beforehand sent some friends for them to say to him: “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you come under my roof.
7 Therefore I did not count myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and cause my slave to be healed. 8 For I as well am a man under authority [túre = power], having soldiers under me, and if I say to this one: Go! – then he goes, or to another: Come! – then he comes, or to my slave: Do so! – then he does that.” 9 And when Jesus heard these things he was filled with wonder about him, and he turned [Q: turned himself] to the crowd following him and said: “I tell you, even in Israel I have not found a faith that great.” 10 And [the ones] that were sent, when they returned to the house, found the slave in health.
	11 And thereafter [it] happened that he went into a city called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him. 12 And when he came near to the gate of the city, a dead man was carried outside, the only-born son of his mother. Furthermore, her husband was dead. A great crowd from the city was also with the woman.
12 And when the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her, and he said to her: “Do not be wailing!” 13 And having come near he touched the bier, and the bearers stopped, and he said: “Young man, I say to you: Rise!” 15 And the dead man sat up and started to talk, and Jesus gave him to his mother. 16 Now fear seized them all, and they gave glory to God, saying: “A great prophet has been raised up among us,” and: “God has heeded his people!” 17 And this word spread into all Judea and the whole surrounding country.
	18 And John's disciples told him about all these things. 19 And John called two of his disciples and sent them [tu, dual] to the Lord to say: “Are you [the one] that was going to come, or is it necessary for us to look forward to another?” 20 When they [-tte, dual] came to him, the men said: “John the Baptist sent us to you to say: Are you [the one] that was going to come, or is it necessary for us to wait for another?”
21 In that hour he healed numerous ones, freeing them from illnesses and from sufferings and from wicked spirits, and many blind ones he caused to see. 22 And he answered them [túna, dual]: “Go away, tell John what you [dual] saw and heard: The blind receive sight, the skin-diseased are made clean and [those] that lacked hearing hear, the dead ones are raised, and happy is [the one] that does not find in me a cause for falling.”
	24 After the men send by John went away, he began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go into the desert to look at? A reed moving by the wind? 25 No, what did you go out to see? A man having soft clothes? Behold, those having soft clothes are in the houses of kings! 26 But what [was] your reason for going out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet!
27 He was [the one] about whom it has been written: 'Behold! I send my herald before your face, to prepare your way before you.' 28 I tell you: Among [those] that were born of women [there] is no one greater than John, but a person among the smaller in God's kingdom is greater than he.” 29 And the whole people and the tax collectors, when they heard that, said that God was just, they being baptized with John's baptism. But the Pharisees and the lawyers turned away [that] which God wanted for them, they that were not baptized by him.
	31 “With whom, then, shall I compare this generation? 32 They are like children sitting in a market-place and crying one to the other: 'We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we were wailing, but you did not have tears.' 33 For John the Baptist has come, not eating bread or drinking vine, but you say: He is possessed by a demon! 34 The Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, but you say: Look! A man over-eating and given to drinking vine, friend of tax collectors and sinners!' 35 And yet wisdom is shown [to be] just by all its children.”
	36 A person among the Pharisees requested that Jesus was to eat with him, and coming into the Pharisee's house he laid down by the table. 37 And behold! a woman who was known in the city as a sinner learnt that he was at the table in the house of the Pharisees, and she bought [lit. traded to herself] a stone-box of fragrant oil, 38 and standing in tears behind Jesus by his feet, the woman started to make his feet wet with her tears and wiped them off with the hair of her head, and she kissed his feet and annointed them with the fragrant oil. 39 Seeing that, the Pharisee who invited Jesus said to himself: “This man, if he was a prophet, would know who and of what kind is this woman that is touching him – that she is a sinner!” 40 But in answer Jesus said to him: “Simon, I have something that I want to say to you.” He said: “Teacher, say it!”
	“Two men had a debt to a person from whom they received money; one had a debt of five hundred denarii, the other, fifty. 42 When they had nothing to give back to him, he foregave both. Then who among them [tú, dual] will love him [the] more?” 43 In answer Simon said: “I suppose the person to whom he forgave the greatest sum.” He said to him: “You judged well.”
	44 Then he turned [Q: turned himself] to the woman and said to Simon: “Are you seeing this woman? I came into your house; you did not give me water for my feet. But this woman made my feet wet with her tears and wiped them away with her hair. 45 You did not give me [any] kiss, but this woman, from the hour that I came, did not cease to kiss my feet. 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but this woman anointed my feet with fragrant oil. 47 For this reason I say to you: Her numerous sins are forgiven her, for she loved much; but [the one] to whom a little is forgiven, loves little.”
48 Then he said to her: “Your sins are forgiven.” 49 But those who lay with him at the table began to say in themselves: “Who is this man that even forgives sins?” But he said to the woman: “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”
CHAPTER 8
And it happened [lit. came] thereafter that he went from city to city and from village to vilalge and taught and made known the gospel about God's kingdom, and the twelve followed him, as did some women that were healed from wicked spirit and illneses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, 3 and Joanna the wife of Cuza, Herod's commander, and Susanna and numerous other women, who served him with their goods.
	4 Now when a great crowd had gathered with [those] that went with him from city to city, he said to them in a comparison: 5 “A sower went out to sow. In his sowing some seeds fell beside the road and were trampled down, and the birds of heaven ate them. 
6 Others fell upon the rock, and after they sprouted they withered, for lacking water. 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with them choked them. 8 Others fell upon the good soil, and after they sprouted they made fruit, a hundred added measures.” After telling these things, he cried: “May [the one] that has ears hear!”
	9 But his disciples asked him: “What does the comparison mean?” 10 He said: “To you [it] is given to know the secrets of God's kingdom, but to the others it is in comparisons, causing them to look without seeing and hear without understanding. 11 This is what the comparison means: The seed is God's word. 12 [The ones] that are beside the road are [the ones] that have heard; then the Devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, to stop them from believing and from being saved.
13 [The ones] that are on the rock are [those] that receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they do not have [any] root; they believe for [ter = through] a time, but in a time of testing they fall away. 14 [Those] that fell among the thorns, they are [the ones] that have heard, but being carried away by the anxieties of this life and by riches and by joys, they are choked and complete nothing. 15 But [the ones] that are on the good soil, they are [the ones] that hear the word with a good and beautiful heard and keep it and make fruit by steadfastness.
	16 [There] is no one who having kindled a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but he puts it on the lampstand, allowing [the ones] that come inside to look at the light. 17 And [there] is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, or a single thing veiled that will not ever be known or easily seen.
18 Therefore take heed how you listen, for anyone who has, more will be given to him, but anyone who does not have, also [that] which he believes he has will be taken from him.”
	19 Now his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach to him because of the crowd. 20 But people told him: “Your mother and your brothers are standing on the outside, wishing to see [or, meet] you.” 21 In answer he said to them: “My mother and my brothers are [those] who hear God's word and do it.”
	22 It happened [lit. came] in one of the days that he and his disciples went into a boat, and he said to them: “Let us pass over to the other shore of the lake.” Thus they sailed away. 23 But while they sailed he slept. Now a storm fell upon the lake, and their boat was filled, and they were in danger. 24 In the end they went to him and woke him up, saying: “Teacher, teacher, we are dying!” But after rising he rebuked the wind and the violence of the water, and they were made [to be] at rest, and [there] was a silence.
25 Then he said to them: “Where [is] your faith?” But being scared they were in wonder, saying one to the other: “Who indeed is this man, for he commands also [or, even] the winds and the water, and they do as he says?”
	26 And they sailed to [the] country of the Gerasenes, which lies on the other shore from Galilee. 27 And when he went on land, [there] met him a man from the city who was possessed by a a demon; for [ter, 'through'] a long time he did not bear clothes, and he did not dwell in a house, but among the tombs. 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried [out] and fell down before him, and he said in a mighty voice: “What [is there] for me and for you [= what do you have to do with me], Jesus, son of the Most High God? I beg of you, to not torment me!” 29 For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Beforehand the demon for a long time kept the man fast, and he was bound by chains and by bonds on his feet, while guards watched him, but he tore over the bonds and was driven by the demon into the lonely places.
30 Jesus asked him: “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” for numerous demons had gone into him. 31 And they requested of him that he would not send them into the abyss. 32 But [there] was there a great flock of swine on pasture in the mountain, and they requested of him that he would allow them to pass into them. And he allowed them. 32 Then the demons went out of the man and went into the swine, and the flock went rushing over the edge into the lake and drowned. 34 But when the herders saw [that] which had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the fields. 
	35 Then people came out to see [that] which had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, bearing clothes and in health of mind, sitting by Jesus' feet, and they were terrified.
36 [Those] that saw it told to them how the demon-possessed man was saved. 37 And the whole multitude from thesurrounding country of [the] Gerasenes requested of him to go away from them, for they were seized by great fear. Then he went into the boat and sailed away. 38 But the man out of whom the demons were come begged that he would [Q: will] allow him to remain with him. But he sent the man away, saying: 39 “Return to your home, and tell about the things that God has done for you.” And he went away through the entire city, making known everything that Jesus did for him.
	40 When Jesus returned [i.e. to where he had come from], he was received by the crowd, for all waited for him. 41 But behold! a man called Jairus came, and he was the chief of the synagogue. And he fell down before Jesus' knees [occat, dual] and requested of him that he would come to his house, 42 for [there] was with him a daughter, his only child, who had [an age of] about twelve years, and she near to death.
When Jesus was on his way, the crowds pressed against him. 43 And a woman, who for [ter = through] twelve years suffered from [-nen] a flood of blood, for whom it was not possible to get healing from anyone, 44 came behind him and touched the rim of his cloak, and in the same moment the flood of blood stopped. 45 And Jesus said: “Who was [the one] that touched me?” When all denied it, Peter said: “Teacher, the crowds lie heavily on you and are pressing against you.” 46 And yet Jesus said: “A person touched me, for I perceived how force went out of me.” 47 Seeing that she did not escape notice, the woman came trembling and fell down before him and told before the whole people the reason why [yanen = by which] she touched Jesus and how she was healed in the same moment. 48 But Jesus said to her: “Daughter, your faith has saved you; go away in peace!”
	49 While he still spoke, a man came from [the] house of the chief of the synagogue, saying: “Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the teacher [any]more.” 50 But hearing that, Jesus answered him: “Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be saved.” 51 When he came to the house he did not allow anyone to go inside, except Peter and John and Jacob and the maiden's father and mother. 52 But people were wailing and beat themselves in grief about the maiden. And he said: “Do not be wailing, for she did not die, but she is asleep.” 53 Then they laughed at him, since they knew that she was  [Q: is] dead. 54 But he took her hand and cried [out], saying: “Maiden, rise!” 55 And her spirit returned, and she arose in the same moment, and Jesus commanded that one gave her something to eat. 56 And her parents were beside themselves; but he instructed them that they were not to tell anyone about [that] which had happened.
CHAPTER 9
Then he summoned the twelve and gave them control and power over all the demonds, and allowed them to heal diseases. 2 And he sent them to make known God's kingdom and to heal, 3 and he said to them: “Carry nothing for the journey – not staff or bag, not bread or money, and do not bring two tunics.
4 But when you go into a house, remain there and go away from there. 5 For in every place where people do not heed you, when you go away from that city shake the dust from your feet [dual] as a witness to them.” 6 Then, going out, they went though the region from village to village, making known the gospel and healing people in every place.
	7 Now Herod the farthing-ruler heard about everything that happened, and he was confused, since [it] was said by some that John was raised out of [the] dead, 8 but by others that Eliah had [Q: has] come, but by others that one among the ancient Prophets had [Q: has] been raised. 9 Herod said: “John's head I cut off. Who, then, is this person of whom I hear such things?” And he sought to see him.
10 And when the apostles returned they told Jesus about all their deeds. Then he brought them and went to a lonely place, by a city called Bethsaida. 11 But the crowds, knowing whither he went, followed him. And he received them and talked to them about God's kingdom, and he healed [those] who had need of healing. 12 Then, when the day was fading, the twelve came to him and said to him: “Send the crowd away, for them to go into the villages and fields around us, to find a place to remain and food, for here we are in a lonely place.” 13 But he said to them: “You give them something to eat.” They said: “We do not have more than five breads and two fish, if perhaps we are not to go and trade to ourselves [= buy] food for all these people.” 14 For they were around five thousand people. But he said to his disciples: “Make them lie down in groups of people around fifty in each group.” 15 And they did so and made them all lie down. 16 Then he took the five breads and two fish and looked into heaven, blessed them and broke them, and he gave them to the disciples to put them before the crowd. 17 And all ate and were filled, and the remaining pieces that they gathered filled twelve baskets.
	18 And it happened [lit. came], when he prayed being alone, that the disciples assembled to him, and he asked them so: “Who do the crowds say that I am?” 19 In answer they said: “John the Baptist; or others: Elijah, or others: that one of the ancient prophets has risen.” 20 Then he said to them: “But you, who do you say that I am?” In answer Peter said: “God's Christ!” 21 Then in harsh speech he instructed them that they were not to say so to anyone, 22 but he said: “It is necessary for the Son of Man to go through many sufferings and to be rejected [auquerna, turned away] the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be slain, and on the third day he will be raised up.”
23 Then he said: “If anyone wants to come after me, it is necessary for him to deny himself and lift [up] his cross every day and follow me. 24 For anyone who wishes to save his life, to him it will be lost, but anyone whose life is lost for my good, he will save it. 25 Indeed how is [it] beneficial to a man if he obtains the whole world, but his own person is lost or destroyed to him? 26 For anyone who is ashamed over [-nen] me and over my word, over him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he shall come in his glory and in the Father's and the holy angels' glory. 27 But I say to you in truth: [There] are some that stand here that will not taste death before they will see God's kingdom.”
	28 It happened [lit. came] after these words, after eight days, that he brought Peter and John and Jacob and went up into the mountain to pray. 29 And as he was praying [lit. in his praying] the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes glittered with whiteness. 30 And behold! two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah. 31 They showed themselves [dual] in glory and spoke about the going away that he was to complete in Jerusalem. 32 But Peter and those that were with him were heavy with sleep; but after awakening they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. 33 And when they [dual] went away from him, Peter said to Jesus: “Teacher, it is good that we are here. Therefore let us erect [orta = raise] three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah” – for he did not know what he said. 34 But when he said these things [there] was a cloud that overshadowed them, and they were terrified when they went into the cloud. 35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: “This is my son, who has been chosen. Listen to him!” 36 And after the voice came, Jesus was found [to be] alone. But they were silent and did not tell anyone in those days about the things that they saw.
37 On the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a big crowd met him. 38 And behold! a man cried out of the crowd, saying: “Teacher, I beg of you that you see to my son, for he is my only child, 39 and behold! a demon seizes him, and suddenly [rincenen: with a sudden twist] he cries [out], and it causes him to twitch and foam, and it hardly goes away from him after wounding him. 40 And I begged of your disciples that they would expel the demon, but [it] was not possible for them.” 41 In answer Jesus said: “O unfaithful and twisted generation, how long will it be necessary for me to remain with you and to bear you? Lead your son hither!” 42 But when that one was still coming near, the demon threw him to the ground and caused him to twitch. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him to his father. 43 And all marvelled about God's majestic power.
	Now when they were seized by wonder about all the things that he did, he said to his disciples: 44 “Always keep these words in mind, for the Son of Man will be given over into the hands of men.” 45 But they did not understand this saying; it was being hidden from them, to stop them for perceiving what it meant, and they were afraid to ask [Q: feared from asking] him about this saying. 
	46 Then [there] was a strife among them about who was the greatest among them. 47 Jesus, knowing how they thought in their heart, took a child and put it next to himself 48 and said to them: “Anyone who receives this child in my name receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the one who sent me. The smallest [one] among you is the greatest.”
	49 In answer John said: “Teacher, we saw a man expelling demons by your name, and we tried to stop him, since he was not with us.” 50 But Jeus said to him: “Do not stop him, for [he] that does not stand against you is for you!”
51 Now when the time came near for his being received up, he turned his face towards Jerusalem to go there. 52 He sent heralds before himself, and they went away and went into a village of [the] Samaritans, to prepare for him. 53 But they did not want to receive him, since he was on his way to Jerusalem. 54 When the disciples Jacob and John saw [dual] that, they [dual] said: “Lord, do you wish that we are to command fire to come down from heaven to destroy them?” 55 But he turned himself and rebuked them [dual]. 56 Then he went away to another village.
57 When they went on the way a person said to him: “I will follow you to every place that you go away to.” 58 And Jesus said to him: “Foxes have holes [or, dens/lairs] and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of Man does not have [any] place to put his head.”
59 Then he said to another man: “Follow me!” The man said: “Allow me first to go away and bring my father to the grave.” 60 But he said to him: “Let [the] dead bring their dead to the grave, but you go and make the kingdom of heaven known!” 61 And another said: “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say farewell to [those] that are in my house.” 62 But Jesus said to him: “Nobody who has put his hand on the plough and looks at the things that lie behind him, is fit for God's kingdom.”
CHAPTER 10
After these things the Lord chose seventy others and sent them forth two and two before himself, to every village that he himself would come to. 2 He said to them: “The harvest is abundant, but those who work are few. Therefore ask of the Lord of the harvest, for him to send people to gather his harvest. 3 Go out! Behold! I send you like lambs among wolves. 4 Do not carry a pouch, or a bag for food, or a pair of shoes; and do not greet anyone on the road. 5 When you come into a house, first say: 'May this house have peace!' 6 And if [there] is there a friend of peace, your peace will rest upon him. But if [there] is not one, it will return to you. 7 Therefore remain in that house, eating and drinking the things that they give you, for [he] who works is worthy of his reward. Do not move from house to house. 
	8 Furthermore, when you go into a city and they receive you, eat the things put before you, 9 and heal the sick ones in it, and tell them: 'God's kingdom has come near to you.' 10 But whenever you come into a city and they do not receive you, go into their broad ways and say: 11 'Also [/even] the dust which stuck to our feet [dual] from your city we shake away to you. But this thing you are to know, that God's kingdom has come near!' I am telling you: To Sodom the day of judgement will be more bearable than what it will be to that city.
	13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds that have happened in you [dual] happened in Tyre and Sidon, long ago they found repentence, sitting in sack and ash. 14 Therefore for Tyre and to Sodom the judgement will be more bearable than for you! [dual] 15 And you, Capernaum, will you perhaps be raised up to heaven? Down to Mandos [Hades] you will come!
	16 [He] who listens to you listens to me. And [he] who fails to heed you, fails to heed me. Therefore, [he] who fails to heed me, fails to heed [the one] who sent me.”
	17 Then the seventy returned with [lit. in] joy, saying: “Lord, also [/even] for the demons it is necessary to heed our orders in your name!”  18 Then he said to them: “I saw Satan fallen like a flash out of heaven. 19 Behold! I have given you the power to trample under your feet serpents and scorpions and the entire might of the enemy, and nothing can wound you. But do not have joy about your control over the demons, but have joy since your names have been written in heaven.”
21 At that time he was most happy by the Holy Spirit and said: “I praise you, Father, Lord over heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from wise ones and from intelligent ones, and you have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for doing so was good in your eyes. 22 All things have been given over to me by my Father, and who the Son is nobody knows except the Father, and who the Father is, nobody knows except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.”
	23 And after turning [Q: turning himself] towards the disciples he said: “Happy are the eyes [dual] that behold [the things] you behold. 24 For I say to you: Numerous prophets and kings wished to see the things that you behold, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.”
25 And behold! a scribe arose, to test him, and he said: “Teacher, what am I to do to be heir of eternal life?” 26 He said to him: “What is written in the Law? How do you read?” 37 In answer he said: “You are to love the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strenght and your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” 28 Jesus said to him: “You answered well; do so and you will have life.”
	29 But he, wishing to show that he was [Q: is] just, said to Jesus: “And who is my neighbor?” 30 In answer Jesus said: “A man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among robbers, that took his clothes and beat him, abandoning him between life and death. 31 As [it] happened, a priest went down on that road, but when he saw him, he passed by in the other edge of the road.
38 In the same manner also a Levite, when he came down to the place and saw him, passed by away from him. 33 But a Samaritan man travelling on the road came to him, and when he saw him, his heart went out to him. 34 He came near to him and wrapped his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he placed him on his animal and brought him to an inn and heeded his needs. 35 And on the following day he took two denarii, gave them [dual] to the chief of the inn, and said: 'Heed his needs, and everything that you use beyond this, I will pay you back when I shall return hither.'
	36 Who among these three do you think made himself a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?” 37 He said: “[He] who had mercy on him.” Jesus then said to him: “You go and do the same thing.”
38 Now when they went away he went into a city. Here a woman called Martha received him into her house. 39 [There] was with this woman a sister whose name was Mary, who sat down by the feet of the Lord and listened to his word. 40 But Martha had her hands full with much work, and she came and said: “Lord, is it not important to you that my sister has left me alone in my work? Therefore say to her that it is necessary for her to help me.” 41 In answer the Lord said to her: “Martha, Martha, you have anxiety and you are troubled about numerous things. 42 But of a single thing [there] is need. Mary has chosen the good part, and it will not be taken from her.”
CHAPTER 11
And it happened [lit. came], when he was in a place praying, that when he stopped one of his disciples said to him: “Lord, teach us [how] to pray, like John also taught his disciples.”
	2 Then he said to them: “Whenever you pray, say: Father, let your name be holy. Let your kingdom come. Give us our daily bread day after day, 4 and forgive us our sins, for also we forgive everyone who has a debt to us; and do not lead us into temptation.”
5 And he said to them: “Who among you that has a friend will go to him in the midst of the night and will say to him: 'Friend, loan me three loaves, 6 for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to put before him'? 7 And he from the inside says in answer: 'Do not trouble me! The door is shut, and my children are with me in the bed; it is not possible for me to rise to give you [anything].' 8 I say to you: If he does not rise and give to him since he is his friend, indeed he will rise and give to him because of his persistence [vorongandele]. 9 Therefore I say to you: Ask, and [it] will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 10 For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking [it] will be opened.
11 Surely [there] is not [any] father among you who, if his son asks for a fish, will perhaps give him a serpent instead of a fish? 12 Or if he also asks for an egg, surely he will not give him a scorpion? 13 Therefore, if you that are wicked know [how] to give good gifts to your children, how [much] more the heavenly Father will give Holy Spirit to those that ask of him!”
	14 And he expelled a dumb demon. After the demon came out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds were in wonder. 15 But some among them said: “He expels the demons by the chief of of the demons, Belzebul.” 16 But others, in order to test him, sought from him a sign out of heaven. 17 Knowing their imaginations he said to them: “Every kingdom split against itself is undone, and a home split against itself falls. 18 But if even Satan is split against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I expel the demons by Belzebub's power.
19 If by the power of Beelsebul I throw out demons, by whom do your sons throw them out? For this reason they will be your judges. 20 But if by God's finger I throw the demons out, God's kingdom has indeed come to you. 21 When a strong man, having weapons, protects his own court, his goods are [left] in peace. 22 But when a man stronger than him comes and overpowers him, he takes away the weapons which the other thought were going to [Q: will] give him security, and he distributes the things that he stole from him. 23 [He] who is not with me stands against me, and [he] who does not gather, scatters.
	24 When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through try regions seeking a place of rest, and when it does not find one, it says: 'I will return to my house from which I moved.' 25 And when it comes, it finds it made clean and adorned. 26 Then it goes away and brings with it seven other spirits, more wicked then itself, and after they come in they dwell there, and to that man the last state will be worse than the first.”
	27 Now when he was saying these things, a woman out of the crowd raised her voice and said to him: “Happy the womb that bore you and the teats [dual] from which you were suckled!” 38 But he said: “[It] is better if you say: Happy are [those] that hear God's word and keep it!”
	29 When the crowds gathered, he said: “This generation is an evil generation. It asks for signs, but a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah. 30 For like Jonah became a sign to the people in Nineveh, so also the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation. 31 The queen of the south will be raised in the judgement with this generation and will judge them evil, for she came from the end of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom, and behold, here is [something] more than Solomon. 32 The people from Niniveh will rise in the judgement with this generation and will judge it evil. For they found repentence at [-nen] the message rhat Jonah brought, and behold, here is [something] more than Jonah!
33 After lighting a lamp, one does not put it in a vault or under a measuring basket, but on the lampstand, allowing those that come in to see the light. 34 To the body, the lamp is your eye. When your eye is in health, your entire body is also bright, but when it is evil, your body is also dark. 35 Therefore take heed that that light which is in you is not darkness! 36 Thus, if your entire body is illuminated, not having [any] part which is dark, everything will be illuminated as when the lamp illumulates you with its ray!”
	37 After he said that, a Pharisee requested that he would eat a meal with him. Therefore he went inside and lay down at the table. 38 But the Pharisee was in wonder when he saw that he did not first wash himself before the meal. 39 But the Lord said to him: “Now, O Pharisees! You cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but in the inside of you you are full of theft and wickedness!
40 Senseless ones! [He] who created the outside, did he not also create the inside? 41 But give gifts to poor ones out of [that] which is in your inside, and behold! everything will be clean to you. 42 But woe to you, o Pharisees, since you give the tenth part of the mint and of the rue and of every vegetable, but you pass over the justice and the love for God! These things were necessary for you to do, without passing over the others. 42 Woe to you, o Pharisees, since you love to have the prominent seats in the synagoges and to receive the greatings in the market places. 44 Woe to you, for you are like the tombs that are not easy to see, causing people to walk over them without knowing.”
	45 In answer one among the lawyers said to him: “Teacher, by saying these things you give an evil name also to us.” 46 Then he said: “Woe also to you who are lawyers, for you put on men burders hard to bear, but you do not touch the burdens with a single one of your fingers!
	47 Woe to you, for you build the tombs for the prophets, but your fathers killed them! 48 Indeed you are witnesses and think well of the deeds of your fathers, for they killed the prophets, but you build their tombs! 49 For this reason God's wisdom said: I will send to them prophets and apostles, and they will kill and they will persecute some among them, 50 and so the blood of all the prophets that has been poured out from the foundation of the world until now will be demanded from this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel until the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the House. Yes, I am telling you, it will be demanded from this generation!
	52 Woe to you that are scribes, for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter, and [those] who wished to enter you stopped!”
	53 When he went out from there the the scribes and the Pharisees started to press against him terribly and to pour upon him questions about other things, 54 watching him to seize something out of his mouth.
CHAPTER 12
At that time, when the crowd had gathered in tens of thousands, so numerous that one trampled the other down, he began to say to his disciples first: “Keep yourselves away from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. 2 But [there] is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, or secret that will not be known. 3 Therefore, all things which you say in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you whisper in your own chambers will be made known from the roofs of the houses. 4 Moreover, I say to you that are my friends: Do not fear from [those] that kill the body and thereafter cannot do more. 5 But I will show you whom [Q: from whom] it is necessary for you to fear: Fear [him] who after killing has the power of throwing into Gehenna. Yes, I say to you, fear him!”
	6 Two sparrows [filit: little bird] are [dual] sold for two copper pieces, no? And yet God does not fail to recall one among them [dual]. 7 But  even the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.
	8 But I say to you: Everyone who confesses me before men, him the Son of Man will also confess before God's angels. 9 But [he] who denies me before men will be denied before God's angels. 10 And to everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, that will be fogiven, but to [anyone] who blasphemes agaist the Holy Sprit, that will not be forgiven. 11 But when they bring you before councils and governors and powers, do not have anxiety about how or with what you will defend yourselves, or about what you will say; 12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour about the things that it is necessary for you to say.”
13 Then a person in the crowd said to him: “Teacher, say to my brother that [it] is necessary for him to give me a portion in the inheritance!” 14 He said to him: “O man, who put me [in a position] to judge you [dual] or to distribute to you [dual] your [dual] inheritance?” 15 Then he said to them: “Take heed and protect yourselves from all greed, for also [/even] when a person has abundance, his life does not come from his possessions.” 16 Furthermore, he spoke to them a comparison, saying: “The land of a rich man gave a big harvest. 17 And he made a consideration in his mind, saying: 'What am I to do, now when I lack a place where I can gather my harvest?' 18 And he said: 'I will do so: I will tear down [nancar-, 'undo'] my stores, and I will build some stores larger than them, and there I will gather all my grain and all my good things, 19 and I will say do myself: 'Now you have numerous good things in store for many years. Rest, eat, drink, have joy!'
	20 But God said to him: 'Senseless man! In this night they demand your life from you. Then who will have [the things] that you have gathered?' So [it] will be for [the one] who gathers treasure for himself, but is not rich to God.”
	22 Then he said to his disciples: “For this reason I say to you: Do not have anxiety about yourselves, about what you will eat, or about your bodies, about the things that you will wear. 23 For the life [you have] is more precious than food, and the body than clothes. 24 Give heed to the ravens [or, crows – quácor], that they do not sow or harvest, and they do not have stores or buildings for keeping thigns, and yet God gives them food. How [much] more precious than birds you are! 25 Who among you, by worrying, can add a single cubit to the length of his life? 26 If thus you cannot do the smallest thing, how is [it] that you have worries about the remaining things? 27 Heed how the lilies grow; they do not toil or weave, but I tell you: Also [/even] Solomon in all his glory was not adorned like one among them!
28 If God so adorns the plants in the field, that exist today and tomorrow are thrown into an oven, how much more will he adorn you, you of little faith! 29 Therefore do not seek what you are to eat or what you are to drink, and do not have anxiety, 30 for all these things are [the things] that the nations of the world seek, but your Father knows that you have need of these things. 31 But seek first his kingdom, and these things will be added to you!
	32 Do not be afraid, o little flock, for your Father has thought well to give you the kingdom! 33 Sell [the things] that you have and give gifts to the poor. Make for yourselves pouches that will not ever wear, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where a thief does not come near or a moth devour. 34 For [in the place] where your treasure is, there also your heart will be.
	35 Keep the belt on your hips and your lamps burning, 36 and you be like men waiting for  their master's return from the marriage, for them to be able to open to him in the same moment that he comes knocking.
37 Happy are the thralls whose master, when he returns, finds them watching! Truly I say to you: He will bind around his hip and will allow them to lie at the table, and he will come to be a servant to them. 38 And if he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, happy they are! 39 But know this thing, that if the master of the house knew the time when the thief was going to come, he was awake and did not allow anyone to break into his house. 40 You as well be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at a time that you do not think.
	41 Then Peter said: “Lord, do you speak this comparison to us or also to all?” 42 And the Lord said: “Indeed who is the faithful steward, the intelligent one, in whose oversight his lord will place all his servants, for him to give them their food at the proper time?
42 Happy is that thrall, whom his master when he comes will find doing so. 44 Truly I say to you that over all his goods he will put him. 45 But if that thrall says in his heart: 'My master will not come soon', and he begins to strike the servants and the maidservants, and eats and drinks and fills himself with wine, 46 that thrall's master will come in a day that he does not think and at an hour that he does not know, and he will cut him in two and give him his portion with the faithless ones. 47 Then that thrall who understood his master's wish, but did not prepear himself or did his will, will be beaten with many blows. 48 But [he] who did not understand it, and so did things worthy of beating, will be beaten with few blows. For from anyone to whom much has been given, much will be demanded, and from a person in whose oversight people have placed much, they will demand more than usual.
	49 A fire I have come to throw upon earth, and what am I to wish if it has been kindled even now? 50 A baptism I have that I will be baptized with, and howI am being pressed until it has been completed! 51 Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I say to you, but division! 52 For from now [there] will be five split in a single house, three against two and two against three. 53 They will be split, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, and a woman against her son's wife, and the wife against her husband's mother.”
	54 Then he also said to the crowds: “When you see a cloud rising in the West, in the same moment you say: A storm is coming – and so it will be. 55 And when you see wind that blows from South, you say: It will be hot – and so it will be. 56 Hypocrites, you know [how] to read the appearance of earth and heaven, but how is [it] that you do not know [how] to read this time?
57 How is [it] that you cannot judge also for yourselves what is just? 58 For when you [sg.] are going with your enemy to a judge, strive in the way to be free from your strife with him – or he will draw you before the judge, and the judge will give you over to the court servant [lit. judge-servant], and the court-servant will throw you into jail. 59 I tell you: You [sg.] will not come out from there before you have paid the last small piece of copper!”
CHAPTER 13
At that time some that were there told him about the people from Galilee whose blood Pilate poured forth into the blood of their sacrifices. 2 Therefore in answer he said to them: “Do you suppose that these people from Galilee were sinners greater than all others in Galilee, since they suffered that? 3 By no means, I say to you; but if you do not find repentance, all among you will be destroyed in the same manner. 4 Or the eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, killing them – do you suppose that they had a debt greater than [that] which all others that live in Jerusalem have? 5 By no means, I say to you; but if you do not find repentance, all among you will be destroyed in the same manner.
	6 Then he spoke to them this comparison: “A man had a fig tree in his garden of vines, and he came to seek fruit on it, but he found nothing. 7 Then he said to the gardener: 'Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, but I have found nothing. Cut it down! What reason is [there] for keeping it there, keeping the ground [occupied] without giving fruit?'”  8 In answer he said to him: 'Lord, allow it do stand also this year, and I will dig around it and will place muck there. 9 If it will then give fruit in the coming year, very well. But if it does not, you will cut it down.'”
	10 Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the day of rest. 11 And behold! [there] was there a woman who for [ter, through] eighteen years was possessed by a spirit making her weak: She was bent, and it was not possible for her to stand straight.
12 But when he saw the woman, Jesus called her to himself and said: “Woman, you are freed from the illness making you weak.” 13 And he put his hands on her, and in the same moment she arose to stand straight, and she gave glory to God. 14 But the chief of the synagogue, being angry since Jesus healed on the day of rest, said to the crowd: “There are six days in which it is necessary to work. There come on them to be healed, and not on the day of rest!” 15 But the Lord answered him: “Hypocrites, does not everyone among you on the day of rest loose his ox or his ass from the manger [lit. grass-box] and lead it away to drink? 16 But this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has kept restrained for [lit. through] eighteen years – was it not necessary to loose her from this bond on the day of rest?” 17 And when he said that, all that stood against him were humiliated, and the entire crowd had joy concerning all the glorious things that happened by him.
	18 Therefore he said: “Like what [is] God's kingdom, and with what am I to compare it? 19 It is like a seed of mustard, that a man took and put in his garden, and it grew into a tree, and the birds of heaven dwelt in its branches.”
	20 And again he said: “With what am I to compare God's kingdom? 21 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until everythign was leavened [lit. Swollen].” 
	22 And he went from city to city and from village to village, teaching while he was travelling to Jerusalem. 23 Now a person said to him: “Lord, are the saved ones few?” He said to them: 24 “Strive to go inside through the narrow door! For numerous ones, I say to you, will seek to go inside, but they will not be able, 25 from the hour that he master of the house has arisen and has closed the door, and you stand on the outside, knocking on the door, saying: 'Lord, open to us!' But in answer he will say to you: 'I do not know where you have come from.'
26 Then you will say: 'We ate and drank before you, and you taught in our streets!' 27 But he will answer you so: 'I do not know where you have come from. Begone from me, all who do unrighteousness!' 28 There your wailing and your grinding of teeth will be, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in God's kingdom, but you are thrown outside. 29 Furthermore, people will come from East and West and North and South, and they will lie at the table in God's kingdom. 30 And behold! [there] are some last ones that will be first, and [there] are some first ones that will be last.”
	31 At that time [there] came some Pharisees that said to him: “Go out and go away from here, for Herod wishes to kill you!” 32 And he said to them: “Go and say to that fox: Behold, I throw out demons and I perform healing today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am finished. 32 And yet it is necessary for me to keep travelling on my road today and tomorrow and on the following day, for it is not allowed for a prophet to be destroyed outside of Jerusalem. 34 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those that have been sent to her – how often [rimbave, frequently] I wanted to gather your children like a hen gathers her young under her wings! But you did not want to. 35 Behold, your house is abandoned to yourselves! I am tellomg you that you will by no means see me until you shall say: Blessed is [he] who is coming in the name of the Lord!”
CHAPTER 14
And on an occasion when he went into a house of a chief of the Pharisees to eat bread, they watched him closely.
	2 And behold! [there] was there a man before him who was swollen, having too much water in his body. 3 Therefore Jesus spoke to the lawyers, saying: “Is it allowed on the day of rest to heal, or not?” 4 But they were silent. Then he took the man, healed him and sent him away. 5 And he said to them: “Who among you, if his son or his ox falls into a well, does not pull him [/it] up on the day of rest?” 6 And they could not answer these things.
	7 Then he told a comparison to the men that were invited, when he perceived how they close the most prominent places for themselves, saying to them: 8 “When you are summoned by a person to a wedding, do not lie down at the most prominent place. Perhaps a person more prominent than you has been invited by him, 9 and the person who summoned you will come and say to you: 'Allow this man to have the place!' And then it is necessary for you to go humbled to the lowest place.
10 But when you are invited, go and lie at the lowliest place. Thus, when the man who invited you comes, he will say to you: 'Friend, come up, higher!' Then you will have glory before the people that have been invited with you. 11 For everyone who raises [/elevates] himself will be humbled, but [he] who humbles himself will be raised up.”
	12 Furthermore, he said to [the one] who invited him: “When you make an evening meal or a supper, do not summon your friends, or your brothers, or the people of your kin, or your rich neighbors. Perhaps they also will invite you again, and that will be for you a paying back. 13 But when you make a feast, invite poor ones, cripples, lame ones, blind ones, 14 and you will be happy, for they have nothing with which it is possible for them to repay you. For [it] will be repaid to you in the rising of [the] dead!”
15 Hearing that, one among [those] who lay at the table said: “Happy is [the one] who eats bread in God's kingdom!”
	16 Jesus said to him: “[There] was a man who prepared a great supper, and he invited numerous ones. 17 And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper, to say to [those] who were invited: “Come, for now everything is ready!” 18 But all among them started to give reasons not to come. The first said to him: 'I have bought [lit. traded to myself] a field, and it is necessary for me to go to see it. I beg of you, do not think evil about me since it is not possible for me to come!' 19 And another said: 'I have traded to myself five yokes of oxes, and I am going to test them. I beg of you, do not think evil about me since it is not possible for me to come.' 20 And another said: 'I have married a woman, and therefore it is not possible for me to come.' 21 When he returned, the thrall told these things to his lord. Then the chief of the house was angry and said to his thrall: 'Go with speed into the streets and ways in the city, and bring here the poor ones and cripples and blind ones and lame ones!'
22 And the thrall said: “Lord, what you commanded has been done, and still [there] is place.” 23 And the lord said to the thrall: “Go out into the roads and to the fenced fields and compel them to come inside, in order to fill my house. 24 For I say to you [pl.]: No one among the men that were invited will taste my supper!'”
	25 Now great crowds were travelling with him, and he turned [Q: turned himself] and said to them: 26 “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and his mother and his wife and his sisters, indeed his own life, [it] is not possible for him to be my disciple. 27 To [the one] who is not carrying his cross and coming after me, it is not possible to be my disciple. 28 For who among you that wishes to build a tower does not first sit down to calculate the sum [/cost] of building, to know if he as enough money to complete it? 29 If he does not, perhaps he puts the foundation of the tower [in place], but it is not possible for him to complete it, and all that are watching will perhaps start to speak mockery about him, 30 saying: 'This man started to build, but it was not possible for him to finish.'
31 Or who is the king who will meet another king at war and does not first sit down to make a consideration whether he can with ten thousand warriors fight against [the one] who comes against him having twenty thousands? 32 If he cannot fight against him, he sends people who will speak on his behalf while the other is still far away, seeking peace. 33 Thus, therefore, no one among you that does not say farewell to all his goods can be my disciple.
	34 Salt is indeed good, but if the taste of the salt is gone, with what will one give it taste again? 35 It is not good for soil or as manure alike. People throw it outside. Let [him] who has ears to listen, listen!  
CHAPTER 15
All the tax collectors and sinners came near to him to hear him. 2 Therefore the Pharisees and the lawyers grumbled, saying: “This man receives sinners and eats with them!” 3 Then he spoke this comparison to them: 4 “Who is the man among you having a hundred sheep who does not, if one among them is lost, leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and will seek the lost sheep until he finds it? 5 And after finding it he will put it on his back, having joy. 6 And after coming home he summons his friends and his neighbors and says to them: 'Be happy with me, for I have found my sheep, that was lost.' 7 I say to you that in the same manner, when one sinner finds repentance, [there] is in heaven a joy greater than [that] which [there] is concerning ninety-nine sinners that do not have need of repentance.
	8 Or who is the woman who has ten drachmas who does not kindle a lamp and clean her house if one of them is lost, seeking closely until she finds it? 9 And when she has found it, she gathers her friends [melde: female friend] and says: 'Be happy with me, for I have found the drachma that was lost to me!' 10 Thus, I say to you, [there] will be joy among God's angels concerning one sinner who finds repentance.”
	11 Then he said: “[There] was a man with whom [there] were two sons. 12 And the younger among them [dual] said to his father: “Father, give me the part of the goods that falls to my portion.” Then he divided his livelihood to them [dual]. 13 Thereafter, after not many days, the younger son gathered everything and went away into a remote land, and here he threw away his money on a wild life.
	14 After he used [or, spent] everything, [there] was a severe famine in that land, and he began to have need. 15 He went attaching himself to one of the people that lived in that land, who sent him into his fields to watch pigs. 16 And he wished to fill himself with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him a thing.
17 But when he returned to keenness of perception he said: 'All the paid people that work for my father have an abundance of bread, while I am dying from famine! 18 I will rise and I will go to my father, and I will say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. 19 I am not worthy to still be called your son, but make me like one of the paid people that work for you.'
	20 And he arose and came to his father. When he was still far away, the father saw him, and his heart went out to him, and running to him he fell upon his neck and kissed him. 21 But the son said: 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. 22 I am not worthy to still be called your son. Make me like one of the paid people that work for you.' 23 But the father said to his servants: 'Quickly, bring a cloak, the best one, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet, 23 and bring the fattened young bull, kill it and let us eat and have joy! 24 For this son of mine was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and has been found!' And they began to have joy.
25 But his older brother was in the field, and when he came and went near to the house, he heard music and people dancing. 26 He called one of the servants and asked about what these things meant. 27 He said to him: 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened young bull, since he received him back in good health.' 28 But he was angry and did not wish to go in. Then his father came outside and asked of him [to come]. 29 In answer he said to his father: 'Through so many years I have toiled for you, and your command I did not ever break, and yet you did not give me [even] a young goat for me to have joy with my friends. 30 But when this son of yours has come who devoured your livelihood with whores, you kill the fattened young bull for him!'
	31 Then he said to him: 'Child, you have always been with me, and all [things that are] mine are yours, 32 but it was necessary to a have joy and be glad, for this brother of yours was dead and returned to life, and he was lost and has been found!”
CHAPTER 16
Then he said also to his disciples: “[There] was a man who was rich and had a person overseeing his house, but he heard a bad report about him – that he threw [Q: throws] away his goods. 2 Therefore he summoned him and said to him: 'What is this thing that I am hearing about you? Give a reckoning [or, an account] about your work as a steward, for you will not manage the house [any]more.' 3 Then the steward saod to himself: 'What am I to do, now when [/now that] my lord is wishing to take away my work [/postition] as steward? My strength does not suffice for digging. I shall be humiliated if it is necessary for me to beg. 4 But I know what I will do, causing people to receive me into their houses when my overseership is taken from me!' 5 And summoning to himself the entire group of debtors of his lord, he said to the first: 'What is the sum of your debt to my lord?' 6 He said: 'A hundred measures of oil.' He said to him: 'Take your papers and sit down, and quickly write fifty!'
7 Thereafter he said to another: 'And you, what is the sum of your debt?' He said: 'A hunded cor measures of grain.' He said to him: 'Take your papers and write eighty!' 8 And the lord [or, master] praised the unjust steward, since he behaved wisely – for in their generation, the sons of this age are wiser than the sons of light.
	9 Furthermore, I say to you: Make friends for yourselves with the unrighteous riches! [Q lar, singular]. Thus, when that fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings. 10 [One] who is faithful in that which is smallest, is faithful also in much, and the person who is unrighteous in that which is smallest, is unrighteous also in much. 11 Therefore, if you are not faithful concerning the unrighteous riches, who will put in your keeping that which is true? And if you have not shown your faithfulness concerning that which is another's, who will give you anything that is to be your own?
13 [There] is not [any] servant to whom it is possible to be a slave for two lords, for he will hate one and love the other, or he will stick to one and despise the other. It is not possible for you to be slaves for God and for riches alike.”
	14 But the Pharisees, that loved money, listened to all these things, and they spoke to him with mockery. 15 And he said to them: “You are [the ones] that say that you are just before men, but God knows the heart of all. For that which is sublime to men is disgusting to God. 16 The Law and the Prophets were until John; from then one makes the gospel known, and all are pressing towards it. 17 Heaven and earth will pass away before a single mark in the Law will fall away. 
	18 Everyone who separates himself from his wife and gets married to another, violates [lit. breaks] marriage, and [he] who gets married to a woman divorsed from her husband, violates marriage.
	19 But [there] was a man who was rich, and he covered himself with purple and linen, having joy every day in a glorious manner. 20 But [there] was a beggar whose name was Lazarus, placed by his gate, full of ulcers. 21 He wished to fill himself with [whatever things] that fell from the rich man's table, but also [/even] the dogs came and licked his ulcers.
	22 It happened [lit. came] that the beggar died, and the angels carried him away to the bosom of Abraham. Furthermore, also the rich man died and was brought to his grave.
	23 And he opened his eyes in Mandos [here = Hades], where he existed in torments, and he saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom. 24 Therefore he cried and said: 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, for him to put the tip of his finger in water, to make my tongue cold! For I am tormented in this fire!”
25 But Abraham said: “Child, recall that you received your good things in your life, and Lazarus in the same manner the bad things; but now he receives comfort here, but you have pain. 26 And beside all these things, a big cleft has been placed between us and you [pl.] Thus [those] that wish to go from here to you [pl.] are not able; in the same manner people are not able to pass from there to us.” 27 But he said: “Then I ask of you, father: Send him to my father's house – 28 for I have five brothers – for him to witness to them, to stop them as well from coming to this place of torment!” 29 But Abraham said: “They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them!” 30 But he said: “No, father Abraham, but if a person will come to them from the dead, they will find repentance!” 31 But he said to them: “If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, a person returning from [the] dead will also fail to change their mind.”
CHAPTER 17
Then Jesus said to his disciples: “It is necessary [= unavoidable] that the reasons for falling come, but woe to the person that they come through! 2 If a stone of grinding [= a mill-stone] was put around his nect, and he was thrown into the sea, that was to him better than causing the fall of one among these little ones!
	3 Take heed of yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he has a change of mind, forgive him. 4 And if seven times in a single day he sins against you and he returns to you seven times, saying: 'I have a change of mind!', forgive him!
	5 And the apostles said to the Lord: “Give us more faith!” 6 But the Lord said: “If you had faith like a seed of mustard, you could say to this mulberry tree [morpialda for mor-pie-alda 'black-berry-tree]: 'Pull up your roots and be planted in the sea' – and it was going to do according to your saying.
7 But who among you, having a thrall who works with the plow or as a shepherd, will say to him when he comes from the field: 'Come here quickly and lie down at the table'? 8 Will he not sooner [ambe rato, more soon = rather] say to him: 'Prepare me something for my supper, and bind around your hips and serve [or, wait on] me until I have eaten and drunk, and thereafter you may eat and drink' – ? 9 Surely he does not think that he has a debt to the thrall since he indeed did the things that he received orders about? 10 Thus also yourselves: After you have done all the things that you received orders about, say: 'We are useless slaves. We have done what our debt [or, duty] was.'  
	11 And on his journey towards Jerusalem he passed though the middle of Samaria and Galilee. 12 And when he came into a village, ten skin-diseased men met him, but they stopped far away from him. 13 And they raised their voice and said: “Jesus, teacher, have mercy on us!” 14 And when he saw them he said to them: “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” Then, as they were on the road, they were cleansed.
15 One among them returned when he saw that he was [Q: is] healed, and in a great voice he gave glory to God. 16 And he fell upon his face before Jesus' feet and thanked him; he was a Samaritan man. 17 In answer Jesus said: “Were not the ten healed? Where, then, are the other nine? 18 Was there no man who returned to give glory to God, except this man from another nation?” 19 And he said to him: “Rise and go; by your faith you have received health.”
	20 But when he was asked by the Pharisees about the time when [yasse = in which] God's kingdom was going to come, he said to them in answer: “God's kingdom does not come in a manner allowing people to see it with their eyes. 21 Furthermore, people will not say: 'See here!' or 'There!' For behold, God's kingdom exists in your midst.”
	22 Then he said to the disciples: “[There] will come days when you will wish to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. 23 And people will say to you: 'See there!' or 'See here!' Do not go there and do not run behind them.
24 For like the flash [= lightening], shining from one part under heaven to another part under heaven, so the Son of Man will be. 25 But firstly it is necessary for him to suffer much and to be turned away by this generation. 26 Furthermore, like it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man: 27 They ate, they drank, men married, women were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 28 In the same manner, as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they traded, they bought, they planted, they built. 29 But on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and brimstone fell from heaven and destroyed them all. 30 In the same manner it will be when the Son of Man shall be revealed.
	31 In that day it is necessary for the person on top of his house, who has his goods in the house, not to go down to fetch them, and int he same manner it is necessary for the person in the field not to return to the things behind him.
32 Recall the wife of Lot! 33 To anyone who seeks to keep his life it will be lost, but a person it is lost to, will save it. 34 I tell you: In that night two will be in one bed; one will be brought [along], but the other will be abandoned. 35 [There] will be two women grinding on the same mill; one will be brought along, but the other will be abandoned. [36] 37 And in answer they said to him: “Where, Lord?” He said to them: “Where the body is, there the eagles will gather.”
CHAPTER 18
Then he told them a comparision about the need of praying and not stop trying, 2 saying: “In a city [there] was a judge who did nto have fear of God and did not have respect for [any] man. 3 But [there] was a widowed woman in that city and she came to the judge, saying: “Give me justice from my opponent at law!”
4 But for [ter, through] a time he did not want, but thereafter he said to himself: “Though I do not fear God or have respect for [any] man, 5 I will still bring justice to this woman, or she will come and strike me in the face!” 6 Then the Lord said: “Hear what this unjust judge is saying! 7 Will God not cause justice to be done to those that he has chosen that cry to him at day and night, though he has patience concerning them? 8 I tell you, he will give them justice soon! And yet, when the Son of Man shall come, will he find the faith on earth?””
	9 He also spoke this comparison to [those] that were certain about their own justice and counted the others as nothing: 10 “Two men went up into the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and one was a tax collector. 
11 The Pharisee stood alone and prayed thus: 'O God, I give you thanks since I am not like other men, robbers, unrighteous ones, people who violate marriage, or like this tax collector. 12 I keep fast two times in a week, and of all things that I get I give a tenth [/tithes].' 13 But the tax collector also [/even] did not wish to raise his eyes towards heaven, but he beat his breast, saying: 'O God, have mercy on me, a sinner!' 14 I say to you: This man went home being more righteous than the other, for everyone that exalts himself will be humbled, but  who humbles himself will be exalted.”
	15 Now people brought to him their babies for him to touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 16 But Jesus called them and said: “Allow the children to come to me, and do not stop them, for God's kingdom is for suchlike ones. Truly I say to you: Anyone who does not receive God's kingdom as a child [does], will by no means come into it.”
	18 And one of the rulers said asked him: “Good teacher, what am I to do to be heir to eternal life?” 19 Jesus said to him: “How is [it] that you call me good? No one is good except one, God. 20 You know the commandments: Do not violate [lit. break] marriage. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not witness with a lie. Give glory to your fatehr and to your mother.” 21 Then he said: “All these things I have kept from youth.” 23 Hearing that, Jesus said to him: “[There] is still one thing that you lack. Sell everything that you have and distribute the money to poor ones, and you will have a treasure in heaven; then come and follow me.” 23 When he heard that, he had deep grief, for he was very rich.
	24 Jesus look at him and said: “How difficult [it] is for [those] that have money to come into God's kingdom! Indeed for a camel to pass through a needle's eye [lit. hole] is easier than coming into God's kingdom for a rich person!”
26 [Those] that heard that said: “Then who can be saved?” 27 He said: “The impossible things to men are possible to God.” 28 But Peter said: “Behold, we have abandoned our own things and have followed you.” 29 He said to him: “Truly I say to you, there is no man who has abandoned house or wife or brothers or parents for [the sake of] God's kingdom 30 who will not receive back many times more in this time, and in the coming age eternal life.”
	31 Then he brought the twelve away to a private place and said to them: “Behold! We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be completed. 32 For he will be given over to people of the nations and will suffer mockery and violence, and one will spit upon him, and after flaying him they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise.” 34 But they understood nothing of these things, but this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things said.
	35 Now, when he came near to Jericho, a blind man sat by the road, begging. 36 Since he hard the crowd on the move, he asked about what this meant. 37 They told him: “Jesus from Nazareth is passing by!” 38 And he cried [out], saying: “Jesus son of David, have mercy on me!” 39 And those that went in front of Jesus rebuked him, for him to be silent, but that much more he cried: “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 10 Then Jesus stopped and commanded that they were to bring the man to him. After he came near, Jesus said: 41 “What do you want that I am to do for you?” He said: “Lord, allow me to receive sight!” 42 And Jesus said: “Receive sight; by your faith you have received sight.”43 And in the same moment he received sight, and he followed Jesus, giving glory to God. And the entire people, seeing that, gave praise to God.
CHAPTER 19
And when he came into the city, he went through Jericho. And [there] was there a man whose name was Zacchaeus, and he was a chief tax collector and rich. 3 And he tried to see Jesus, but he could not because of the crowd, and he was not tall.
	4 And running beforehand to a place before them, he climbed into a sycamore tree, to see him, for Jesus was going to pass by that place. 5 And when he came thither, Jesus looked up and said: “Zacchaeus, come down quickly [lit. with speed], for today it is necessary for me to stay in your house!” 6 And he came quickly down and received him with [lit. in] joy. 7 And when all saw it, they were murmuring, saying: “With a man who is a sinner he went in to eat.” 8 But Zacchaeus arose and said to the Lord: “Behold, half of my goods I will give to the poor, and if by compulsion I took money from anyone, I will give back four times the sum!”
9 Then Jesus said to him: “Today salvation has come to this house, for also he is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save [that] which was lost.”
	11 While they listened to these things he also told them a comparison, since he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that God's kingdom was going to show itself there and then. 12 Therefore he said: “A man, an heir, was going to travel to a remote land to receive a kingdom and thereafter to return. 13 He called ten servants and gave them ten minas and commanded them: 'Trade with them until I shall come.' 14 But people of his land hated him and sent behind him people that were going to speak for them, to say: 'We do not want this man as king over us.'
	15 And [it] happened [lit. came] when he returned, after receiving the kingdom, that he commanded that they were to call to him these thralls that he gave the money to, for him to know what they got by trade.
16 Then the first came and said: “Lord, your mina gained ten minas!” 17 Therefore he said to him: “Well done, good slave! Since you have been faithful in the smallest thing, have power over ten cities.” 18 And the second came, saying: “Your mina, lord, made five minas!” 19 He said also to this man: 'Then you rule five cities!' 20 But the other came, saying: 'Lord, here is your mina, which I have kept lying in a cloth. 21 For I feared you, since you are a harsh man; you take up what you did not put down and you reap what you did not sow.' 22 He said to him: 'Out of your own mouth I am judging you, wicked slave! You knew that I am a harsh man who take up what I did not put down and reap what I did not sow? 23 Then how is [it] that you did not put my money on a table? Then, when I came, I was going to receive it with an added sum.'
	24 And he said to those that stood by him: 'Take the mina from him and give it to [the one] who has the ten minas!' 25 But they said to him: 'Lord, he has ten minas!' 26 'I say to you: To everyone that has, more will be given, but to [the one] that does not have, also what he has will be taken away. 27 Furthermore, these enemies of mine that did not want me as their king – bring them here and slay them before my eyes!'”
	28 Thus, after he said these things, he went in front of them towards Jerusalem. 29 And when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany on the mountain called Mount of Olives, he sent froth two of the disciples, 30 saying: “Go into the city before you! [dual] When you [dual] come thither, you will find a colt bound, that no one has ever sat upon. Loose it and bring it! 31 But if anyone says to you: 'What is your reason for loosing it?', you are to say: The Lord has need of it.”
32 And [the two] that were sent forth found it just as he said to them [dual]. 33 But when they loosed the cold, [those] that owned it said to them: “What is your reason for loosing the colt?” 34 They said: “The Lord has need of it.” 35 And they led it to Jesus, and they threw their cloaks upon the colt and put Jesus on it.
	36 As he moved [lit. in his moving] forward people spread their cloaks on the road. 37 When he came near to the decline down from the Mount of Olives the entire host of the disciples began to have joy and to praise God concerning all the mighty deeds that they saw, 38 saying: “Blessed is [he] who is coming, the King, in the name of the Lord. Peace on earth, and glory in the high places!” 39 But some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!” 40 But in answer he said: “I tell you: If these people were silent, the stones would cry [out]!”
41 And when he came near and saw the city, his tears flowed for it, 42 and he said: “Would that you knew in this day [the things] that lead to peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes [dual]. 43 For [there] will come days when your enemies will surround you with a palisade and will press towards you from all directions, 44 and they will throw you and your children to earth, and they will not allow [any] stone to remain upon a stone in you, since you did not know the time when you were inspected!”
	45 And coming into the temple he began to throw out [those] who sold [things], 46 saying to them: “It has been written: 'And my house will be a house of prayer', but you make it a cave of robbers!”
	47 And he taught every day in the temple. But the chielf priests and the scribes and the prominent ones of the people sought to destroy him, 48 and yet they did not find what to do [lit. what they were going to do], for the entire people stuck to him to listen.
CHAPTER 20
And it happened in one of the days, when he instructed the people in the temple and made the gospel known, that [there] came to him the chief priests and the elders 2 and said to him: “Say us by [-nen] what authority you are doing these things, and who has given you this authority!” 3 In answer he said to them: “I too will ask you about [some]thing, and you answer me: 4 John's baptism, was it out of heaven or from men?” 5 They spoke among themselves and said: “If we say: Out of heaven, he will say: Then how is [it] that you did not believe in him? 6 But if we say: From men, the entire people will kill us with stones, for they believe firmly that John was a prophet.” 7 Thus they said that they did not [Q: do not] know. 8 And Jesus said: “Then I as well will not tell you by what authority I to these things.”
	9 And he began to speak this comparison to the people: “A man planted a garden of vines and allowed some cultivators to use it for money, and he went to another land for a long time.
	10 And when the time came, he sent a slave to the cultivators, for them to give him of the fruit from the garden of vines. But the cultivators, after beating him, sent him away empty. 11 But he sent also another slave. Him as well they sent away, after beating him and humiliating him. 12 And yet he again sent a third; him as well they threw outside, after wounding him. 13 Then the lord who had the garden of wines said: 'What am I to do? I will send my beloved son; for him they will have awe.' 14 When the cultivators saw him, they spoke among themselves and said: 'That is the heir! Let us kill him, and we will possess his portion!' 15 And they threw him out of the garden of vines and killed him. Then what will the lord who has the garden do? 16 He will come and put an end to those cultivators and will give the garden to others.” When they heard that, they said: “May it not ever happen!”
17 But again he looked at them and said: “Then what does this thing mean that is written: 'The stone which the builders turned away, it has been made head of the corner' – ? 18 Everyone that falls against that stone will be broken. Anyone upon whom it falls, it will smash him.” 19 And the scribes and the chief priests sought to put their hands upon him in that hour, but they feared the people. For they understood that he told this comparison about them. 20 And after they watched him closely they sent some men [ner-li > nelli] that secretly received money to behave as if they were just, to try to catch him in speech, for them to give him over to those who ruled and into the power of the governor. 21 And they asked him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach as is true, and it is not important to you who a person is, but you teach God's way by the truth. 22 May we pay tax to the High King or not?”
23 But he perceived their cunning and said to them: 24 “Show me a denarius. Whose picture and writing does it have?” They said: “The High King's.” 25 And he saiad to them: “You are to give back, then, the High King's things to the High King, and God's things to God.” 26 And it was not possible for them to seize him in this saying before the people, but they said nothing, in wonder at [-nen] his answer.
	27 But some of the Pharisees, that say that [there] is not [any] resurrection, came and said to him: 28 “Teacher, Moses has written for us: 'If a man's brother dies without child, after he married a woman, it is necessary for his brother to get married to the woman and rise up seed for his brother.' 29 But [there] were seven brothers, and the first got married to a woman, but died without child. 30 Also the second 31 and the third got married to her, in the same manner all the seven without a child to follow them, and they died. 32 In the end also the woman died. 33 Whose wife will she then be in the resurrection? For she was a wife for all the seven.”
34 Jesus said to them: “The children of this age marry and are given in marriage, 35 but [those] that are counted worthy of seeing that age and for the resurrection from the dead do not marry or are given in marriage. 36 Furthermore, they cannot [any]more die, for they are like angels, since they are children of God by being children of the resurrection. 37 But also Moses showed  that [the] dead are raised, in the story about the thorn-bush, when he calls the Lord Abraham's God and Isaac's God and Jacob's God. 38 He is not God of [the] dead, but of living ones, for all among them are alive to him.” 39 In answer some of the scribes said: “Teacher, you spoke well!” 40 And they did not [any]more dare to ask him a single question.
41 But he said to them: “How is [it] that people say that the Christ is David's son? 42 For David himself says in the book of psalms [airilírion = of holy songs]: The Lord said to my lord: Sit by my right hand, 43 until I shall put your enemies under your feet. 44 Thus David calls him lord. Then how is he his son?” 45 While the entire people listened, he said to his disciples: 46 “Watch yourselves because of the scribes that wish to walk [around] in robes and live greetings in the market places and the first seats in the synagogues and the prominent places at the suppers, 47 and that devour the houses of widows and pray long prayes to be seen by others. They will receive a heavier judgement.”
CHAPTER 21
Now when he looked he saw the rich putting their gifts in the treasuries. 2 Then he saw a poor widowed woman who threw in two small copper pieces, 3 and he said: “I tell you truly: This poor widowed woman gave more than them all. 4 For all these [people] gave gifts out of their abundance, but this woman gave the entire livelihood that she had.”
	5 And when some talked about the temple, that it had  [Q: has] lovely stones and was [Q: is] adorned with gifts, he said: 6 “These things that you behold – days will come when stone will not remain upon a stone that will not be thrown down.”
	7 And they asked him: “Teacher, what is the time when these things will be, and what [is] the sign that these things will soon happen?” 8 And he said: “Take heed that you will not be caused to stray! For numerous ones will come in my name, saying: I am he!, and: The time is near. Do not go after [lit. behind] them! 9 Furthermore, when you hear about wars and uprisings, do not be terrified! For it is necessary that these things will come first, but the end does not come at the same time.
	10 Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, 11 and there will be earthquakes, and in place after place pestilences and famines, and [there] will be terrible things seen, and from heaven great signs.
	12 But before all these things people will put their hands [dual] on you and will persecute you, giving you over to the synagogues and to the prisons, when you are drawn before kings and governors concerning my name. 13 That will be for you an opportunity for witnessing. 14 Therefore be firm in your heart that you will not make plans beforehand about how you will speak for yourselves, 15 for I shall give you a mouth and wisdom against which all [of] your enemies will not be able to stand or speak. 16 Furthermore, you will be given over by parents [dual] and by brothers and by your kin and by friends, and they will kill some among you, 17 and you will be hated by all because of [-nen] my name. 18 And yet a hair on your head will by no means be destroyed. 19 By your faithfulness you will save your lives. 
	20 Furthermore, when you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, know that her destruction has come near. 21 Then it is necessary for [those] that are in Judea to flee to the mountains, and for [those] that are in the midst of the city to leave, and for [those] that are in the regions not to enter it, 22 for those days are days of vengeance, to make real all things that have been written. 23 Woe to the women with child and to those that suckle babies in those days! For [there] shall come a great need on the land and wrath upon this people, 24 and they shall fall by the sword and will be led away into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot [dual] by all the nations, until the times of the nations shall be completed.
Furthermore, there will be signs in Sun and Moon and stars, and on earth anxiety of nations that do not see [any] escape, by reason of the noise of the sea and its uprising, when men shall be sick with fear, foreseeing the things coming upon [the] world. For the powers of heaven will be shaken. 27 And then they will see the Son of Man come in a cloud with power and great glory. 28 But when these things begin to happen, stand tall [pl.] and raise your head, for your deliverance is coming near.
	29 And he spoke to them a comparison: “Notice the fig-tree and all the other trees: 30 Also [/even] when they have twigs, you know to yourselves by examining that now the summer is near. 31 Thus you will also know, when you shall see these things happen, that God's kingdom is near. 32 Truly I say to you: This generation will not pass before all things shall happen. 33 Heaven and earth shall pass [dual], but my words will not ever pass [away].
	34 But watch yourselves, to stop your heart from being heavy with over-eating and over-drinking and the anxiety of life, and suddenly [rincinen: with a sudden move] that day will come upon you 35 like a snare. For it shall come upon all that dwell on the surface of the entire earth. 36 But be awake, always praying that you shall be able to excape all these things that will come, and stand before the Son of Man.”
	37 In the days he was in the temple, teaching, but at night he went out and stayed at the mountain called Mount of Olives, 38 and the entire people came early to him in the temple to hear him.
CHAPTER 22
Now the festival of Unleavened Breads, which is called Passover, was near. 2 And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they could destroy him, since they feared the people. 3 But Satan went into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was counted among the twelve, 4 and he went away and spoke with the chief priests and the temple captains about how he was going to give him over to them. 5 Then they were happy and said that they were willing to give him money. 6 And he assemted to what they suggested and sought a good moment to give him over when [there] was not a crowd with them.
	7 Now came the day of unleavened breads, on which it was necessary to kill the lamb of passover, 8 and he sent Peter and John, saying: “Go and prepare for us the passover, for us to eat.” 9 They [dual] said to him: “Where do you wish that we [dual] are to make it ready?” 10 He said to them [dual]: “Behold, when you [dual] go into the city, a man who is carrying an earthen vessel will meet you [dual]. Follow him into the house into which he shall go. 11 And you [dual] are to say to [him] who has the house: “The Teacher says to you: Where is the place where I can eat the passover with my disciples?” 12 And that man will show you [dual] a big furnished upper room. Prepare there!” 13 And they [dual] went away and fount the things as he said to them [dual], and they [dual] prepared for the passover.
	14 And when the time came, Jesus lay at the table, and the apostles with him. 15 And he said to them: “I have much desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer, 16 for I say to you: I will not eat it again before it shall be completed in God's kingdom.”
	17 And receiving a cup he gave thanks and said: “Take this and send it from person to person among you. 18 For I say to you: From now I shall not drink from the fruit of the vine before God's kingdom shall come.”
	19 Furthermore, he took a bread, gave thanks, broke it and said: “This is my body, that will be given on your behalf. Do this to recall me.” 20 And the cup in the same manner after they ate the evening meal, he saying: “This cup is the new covenant by means of my body, which will be poured out on your behalf.
	21 But behold, my betrayer's hand is with me on the table. 22 For the Son of Man is going away, as he is destined; and yet woe for the person through whom he is given over!” 23 Therefore they began to talk among themselves about who among them was [the one] that was going to do this thing.
	24 But [there] was also a quarrel between them about who among them seemed to be the greatest. 25 But he said to them: “The kings of the nations are their lords, and [those] that have power over them are called benefactors. 26 But you do not be so. It is necessary for [the one] who is the greatest among you to be like the youngest, and for [him] who rules, to be like a servant. 27 For who is the greatest, [the one] who lies at the table or the servant? Is it not [the one] who lies at the table? But among you I am like the servant. 
	28 But you are [the ones] that have remained with me in my trials, 29 and I make a covenant with you, like my Father has made with me a covenant, about a kingdom, 30 for you to eat and for you to drink at my table in my kingdom, and for you to sit on thones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
	31 Simon, Simon, behold! Satan has demanded to sift you like grain! 32 But I have prayed concerning you, that your faith will not be insufficient, and when at [some] time you have returned, bring strength [antoryame, strengthening] to your brothers.”
33 Then he said to him: “Lord, I am ready to go with you into prison and death alike!” 34 But he said: “I say to you, Peter: A cock will not sound today before you have said thrice that you do not know me.”
	35 And he said to them: “When I sent you [forth] without purse and food-box and shoes, surely you did not lack a single thing?” They said: “We did not.” 36 Then he said to them: “But now it is necessary for [the one] who has a purse to bring it, in the same manner a food-box, and it is necesssary for [the one] how lacks a sword to sell his cloak and get a sword for the money. 37 For I say to you that it is necessary that this thing written about me will be made true: 'And he was counted among lawless ones.' For [that] which concerns me will be completed.” 38 Then they said: “Lord, see, here are two swords.” He said to them: “They [dual] are enough.”
	39 After he went out he went, as his habit was, to the Mountain of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
40 Having come to the place he said to them: “Pray, to stop yourselves from coming into temptation!” 41 And he went away from them, about a stone's throw, and he fell to his knees [dual] and prayed, 42 saying: “Father, if you wish, take this cup from me! And yet, may your will happen, not mine.” 43 Then an angel from heaven showed himself to him and brought him strength. 44 But coming into an agony he prayed still more arduously, and his face was wet with what was like drops of blood, falling to the ground. 45 And he arose from prayer, went to the discuples and found them asleep with grief, 46 and he said to them: “What is your reason for being asleep? Rise and pray, to stop yourselves from coming into temptation!”
	47 While still he spoke, behold! a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, went in front of  them. He came to Jesus to kiss him.
48 But Jesus said to him: “Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?” 49 When the people with him saw what was going to happen, they said: “Lord, are we to strike with the sword?” [macil-nen > macilden] 50 And one among them struck the chief priest's slave and cut off his right ear. 51 But in answer Jesus said: “Let this as well happen.” And he touched the ear and healed him. 52 Jesus then said to the chief priests and to the temple captains and to the elders that were come there to seize him: “Have you come having swords and clubs, as upon a robber? 53 Day after day I was with you in the temple, and you did not put your hands on me. But this is your hour, and darkness rules.”
	54 Then they seized him andd led him away and brought him into the chief priests's house, but Peter followed nearby. 55 When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. 56 But [there] was a maidservant who saw him by the fire, and after watching Peter she said: “Also this man was with them.” 57 But he denied it, saying: “I do not know him, woman!” 58 After a short time another person, seeing him, said: “You as well [are] one among them!” But Peter said: “Man, I am not!” 59 And after about an hour was past, another man said firmly: “Indeed this man was with him! He is also from Galilee!” 60 But Peter said: “Man, I do not know what you are saying!” And in that moment, while he was still speaking, a cock sounded. 61 And the Lord turned [Q: turned himself] and looked at Peter, and Peter recalled the saying of the Kord when he said to him: “Before a cock sounds today, you will deny me thrice.” 62 And he went outside and broke down in tears.
	63 Now the men that had him in custody behaved towards with with scorn, striking him. 64 And after they covered him they asked: “Speak like a prophet! Who was [the one] that struck you?”  And numerous other blasphemies they spoke to him. 
	66 When the day came, the council [or, congregation] of elders of the people, the chief priests and the scribes alike, assembled. And they drew him before their council, saying: 67 “If you are the Christ, tell us!” But he said to them: “Also [/even] if I told you, you were by no means going to believe it. 68 Furthermore, if I told you, you were by no means going to give me an answer. 69 But from now the Son of Man shall sit beside God's right hand of power.” 70 Then all among them said: “Are you, then, God's son?” 71 He said to them: “You say that I am.” 71 They said: “What more need do we have of witnesses? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth!”
CHAPTER 23
And after their entire multitude arose, they led him to Pilate. 2 They began to speak about his supposed crimes, saying: “This man we have found subverting [lit. under-turning] our nation and forbidding that anyone pay taxes to the High King, and he says about himself that he is Christ, a king.”
3 But Pilate asked him: “Are you king of [the] Jews?” In answer he said: “You say it.” 4 But Pilate said to the chief priests and to the crowds: “I do not find [any] crime on [the part of] this man.” 5 But they pressed him, saying: “He stirs up the people, teaching through the entire Judea, and after beginning in Galilee he has come also [/even] here!” [sir = hither] 
	6 But Pilate, when he heard that, asked if the man was from Galilee. 7 And after he knew [for sure] that he was indeed from Herod's kingdom, he sent him to Herod, since also he was in Jerusalem in those days. 8 But Herod, when he saw Jesus, had great joy, for beforehand he long wished to meet him, after hearing about him, and he had the hope that he was going to see a sign happen by him. 9 He asked him many questions, but he answered him nothing.
10 But the chief priests and the scribes arose and talked about crimes that they said he did. 11 Then Herod and his guards thought that he was nothing, and in mockery they covered him with a bright garment and sent him back to Pilate. 12 On that day Herod and Pilate started a friendship, one with the other, for before this they were enemies.
	13 Pilate then assembled the chief priests and the people 14 and said to them: “You brought this man to me as one who stirs up the people, and behold! I examined him before you, but I did not find in him [any] guilt concerning the things that you say he has done. 15 Indeed also Herod did not [= Indeed neither did Herod], for he has sent him back to us, and behold! nothing worthy of death has been done by him. 16 Therefore I will chastise him; then I will release him. [17] 18 But their entire host cried: “Take away this man, but release to us Barabbas!” 19 He was a man thrown into prison by reason of an uprising that had happened in the city, and of murder. 
20 Again Pilate called them, since he wanted to release Jesus. 21 Then they cried, saying: “Crucify him, crucify him!” 22 For the third time he said to them: “Than what evil has this man done? Nothing worthy of death I found in him. After giving him chastisement I will therefore release him.” 23 But they pressed him with loud [lit. great] shouts, demanding his crucifixion, and their shouts prevailed. 24 And Pilate judged that they were going to get what they wanted. 25 He released to them the man thrown into prison because of [-nen] an uprising and because of murder, whom they asked for, but Jesus he gave over to their will.
	26 And when they led him away, they seized a person called Simon from Cyrene who came from the fields, and they compelled him to carry his cross. 27 But [there] followed him a great multitude from the people, and some women that struck themselves with [-nen] grief and were wailing for him.
28 Jesus turned [Q: turned himself] towards them and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not be wailing for me! Be wailing for yourselves and for your children, for behold! days are coming in which people will say: 'Happy are the women without fruit, and the wombs that did not conceive and he nipples that did not suckle!' 30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains: 'Fall upon us!', and to the hills: 'Cover us!' 31 For if they do thest things when the tree is moist, what will happen when it has withered?”
	32 But two other men, evildoers, were also led thither to be slain with him. 33 And when they came to the place called Skull, they crucified him and the evildoers, one on his right and one on his left, 34 But Jesus said: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Furthermore, to distribute his garments they threw lots. 35 And the people watched. But the rulers talked with mockery, saying: “Others he has saved; let him save himself, if this man is God's Christ, the chosen one.”
36 Also the soldiers behaved towards him with scorn. They came near and presented him with sour wine 37 and said: “If you are king of [the] Jews, save yourself!” 38 Also [there] was a writing above him: “This is the king of [the] Jews.”
	39 But one of the hanging evildoers blasphemed him: ”Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” 40 In answer the other rebuked him and said: ”Do you not fear God, now that you are under the same judgement? 41 And we [dual] justly so, for we are receiving that to which we are worthy by the things that we have done, but this man has done nothing evil.” 42 And he said to him: “Jesus, recall me when you come in your kingdom!” 43 And he said to him: “Truly I say to you: Today you will be with be in Paradise.”
	44 Now the hour was around the eighth, and darkness fell upon the entire earth until the ninth hour, 45 since the sunlight failed. Then the curtain in the temple was torn down the middle. 46 And crying with a mighty voice, Jesus said: “Father, into your hands I give over my spirit!” Having said that he expired.
	47 When the centurion saw what happened, he gave glory to God and said: “Truly this man was just!” 48 And all the crowds that were gathered for this sight, when they saw [the things] that happened, went away beating their chest. 49 But [those] that knew Jesus stood far away, also the women that came with him from Galilee, watching these things. 50 And [there] came a man whose name was Joseph, a person of the Council, a good and just man. 51 He did not assent to their plan or their deed. He came from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and looked forward to God's kingdom. 52 After going inside to Pilate he asked for Jesus' body.
53 And he took it down and wrapped it with linen, and he put him in a carved-out tomb in the rock, in which no one had lain before. 54 This was the day of Preparation, and the beginning of the sabbath was near. 55 But the women that came with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and the place where his body was placed. 56 Then they went back to prepare spices and fragrant oils. But they rested on the sabbath, according to [or 'by', -nen] the commandment.
CHAPTER 24
On the first day of [lit. in] the week they went very early to the tomb, bearing the spices prepared by them. 2 But they found the stone rolled away from the grave, and when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. 4 While they were in wonder about this, behold! two men with radiant garments stood beside them. 5 When the women were terrified and turned their face towards the ground, the men said to them: “How is [it] that you seek the Living One among [the] dead? 6 He is not here, but he has been raised! Recall how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee, 7 saying that it is necessary for the Son of Man to be given over into the hands of men of sin and to be cruficied and to rise on the third day.”
8 And they recalled his sayings, 9 and they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the others. 10 They were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary mother of Jacob. Also the other women with them told the apostles these things. 11 But these sayings seemed to them like folly, and they did not believe what the women said.
	12 But Peter arose and went to the tomb, and bending forward he saw the wrappings alone. Then he went away, in wonder about what had happened.
	13 But behold! on the same day two among them were on their way to a city called Emmaus, two and a quarter leagues [= 11 kilometers] from Jerusalem, 14 and they [dual] were talking one with the other about all these things that had happened.
	15 Now when they were talking and exchanged words, also Jesus himself came near and walked with them, 16 but their eyes [dual] were kept from knowing him. 17 He said to them: ”What are these words that you are exchanging while you are walking?” And they stood [still], with grief in their face. 18 In answer the man called Cleophas said to him: “Are you the only person dwelling in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened in it in these days?” 19 And he said: “What?” They said to him: “The things that concern Jesus from Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and the entire people 20 – and how our chief priests gave him over to a judgement of death and crucified him. 21 But we had the hope that this man was [the one] that was going to deliver Israel. But besides all these things, now is the third day after this happened.”
22 Furthermore, some women among us have startled us, for after going early to the tomb 23 without finding his body they came saying that they saw a vision of some angels, that said that he is alive. 24 Also, some among us went away to the tomb, and they found that [it] was so, just as the women said, but they did not see him.”
	25 Then he said to them: “O senseless ones, slow of heart to believe all the things that the Prophets said! 26 Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and go into his glory?” 27 And beginning from Moses, and all the Prophets, he caused them to understand the things that concern himself in the Scriptures. 
 	28 And they came to the city that was the [met =] goal of their journey, and he did as if he was going to go forward from there. 29 But they compelled him, saying: “Remain with us [dual], for the evening is near, and the day will soon be gone.” 30 And when he lay with them at the table he took the bread, blessed it, broke it and gave it to them. 31 And in that moment their eyes were fully opened, and they knew him, but he disappeared from them. 32 And they said, one to the other: “Did our heart not burn when he was speaking with us on the road, when he opened the Scriptures to us?“ 33 And in that same hour they arose and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and [those] that were gathered with them, 34 who said: “The Lord has indeed been raised and has shown himself to Simon!” 35 And they told about [the things] that had happened on the road and how he was made known to them by breaking the bread.
36 When they still spoke about these things, Jesus himself stood in their midst and said to them: “May you have peace!” 37 But since they were terrified and had fear, they thought that they saw a spirit. 38 Therefore he said to them: “What is your reason for your fear, and how is [it] that thoughts of unbelief are arising in your heart? 39 See my hands and my feet, that it is I; touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you are seeing that I have.” 40 And saying this he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 But when they still did not believe, for the joy and for the wonder, he said to them: “Are you having here [some]thing to eat?” 42 And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, 43 and he took it and ate it before their eyes.
	45 Then he opened their mind, allowing them to understand the scriptures, 46 and he said to them: “So [it] is written, that the Christ is to suffer, and that he is to rise on the third day, 47 and that by his name one is to make known repentance of sins in all the nations. Beginning from Jerusalem 48 you will be witnesses of these things. 49 And behold! I send you that of which my father gave promise. But you stay in the city until you shall be covered with power from on high.”
	50 Thereafter he led them as far as Bethany, and he raised his hands and blessed them. 51 And while he blessed them, he was taken away from them and carried up into heaven. 52 And they fell down to him and returned to Jerusalem having great joy. 53 And they were always in the temple, blessing God.CHAPTER 1
Paul, thrall of Jesus Christ, called to be apostle, set aside for God's gospel, 2 of which he gave promise beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures, 3 concerning his Son, who arose from David's seed by the flesh, 4 but who was set as the mighty Son of God by the Spirit of holiness, by a raising from [the] dead – Jesus Christ our Lord, 5 through whom we received grace and a place as apostle, to create heeding of the fath among all the nations concerning his name; 6 among whom you are called ones of Jesus Christ – 5 to all that are in Rome as God's beloved, called to be holy ones: May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	8 Firstly I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ concerning all among you, for one talks about your faith in the entire world. 9 For God, to whom I am a servant with my spirit concerning the gospel of his Son, is my witness about how I without cease name you always in my prayers, 10 petitioning that finally, it will be possible for me to come to you, by God's will. 11 For I long to see you, to give you a gift of spirit for you to be firm, 12 or that we exchange comfort, each by the faith of the other, your faith and my faith alike. 
	13 But my brothers, I do not wish that you are to lack the knowledge that I wanted to come to you on numerous occasions – but I have been hindered until know – to receive a measure of fruit also among you, as among the other non-Jews. 14 To Greeks and to Barbarians alike, to wise ones and to fools I am a debtor. 15 Therefore I burn to make known the gospel also to you who are in Rome. 16 For I am not humiliated [/ashamed] concerning the gospel, for it is God's power to save everyone who believes, the Jew firstly, then the Greek. 17 For in it God's righteousness is being revealed by faith and into faith, as is written: “But the righteous – by faith he shall have life.”
	18 For God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of men that keep the truth down in an unrighteous manner, 19 for [that] which one can know about God is made known among them, for God made it known to them. 20 For his invisible true-being is easily seen from the creation of [-va] the world, for they are being perceived by the things made, also his eternal power and divinity. Therefore they cannot defend themselves, 21 for though they knew God, they did not give him the glory or thanksgiving to which he is worthy as Deity, but their thoughts became empty and darkness filled their unintelligent heart. 22 Though they said about themselves that they were wise, they became fools 23 and turned God Immortal's [/the immortal God's] glory into something like the image of mortal man – and of birds and of beasts and of creeping creatures.  
	24 Therefore God gave them over, as the desires of their heart were, to uncleanness that caused the glory of their body to go be lost [lit. to go away] among themselves, 25 they that exchanged God's truth for the lie, and worshiped [that] which was created above [Him] who created, who is being blessed forever. Amen!
	26 Therefore God gave them over to improper lusts, for the women among them exchanged the manner of their nature [nasse, true-being] for a manner beside nature, 27 and so also the men forsook nature's use of the woman [in generic sense] and were kindled with their lust one for [-va] the other, men with men, doing what is perverse, and receiving in themselves the reward that they were worthy of because of [-nen] their error.
28 And since [it] is not good in their eyes [dual] to have knowledge about God, God gave them over to a worthless mind, for them to do immoral things, 29 for they were filled will all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil –  people full of envy, of murder, of strife, of deceit, of a wicked disposition [óre] – whispering, 30 speaking evil about others, hating God, violent, haughty, praising themselves, inventing evil things, not heeding parents [dual], 31 without understanding, breaking their word, unloving, without mercy. 32 Though they know God's decree [namna: statute] – that those who do such things are worthy of death – not only do they do them, but they also give their support to those that do them.
CHAPTER 2
Therefore you do not have [any] reason to give, every [or, any] person that judges. For by the thing with which you judge another, you judge yourself evil, since you who judge do the same things. 2 But we know, as the truth is, that God's judgement falls upon [those] that do such things.
	3 But do you suppose, O man who judges [the ones] that do such things though you too do them, that you will escape God's judgment? 4 Or do you despise the abundance of his gentleness and his forbearance [lavie: 'letting' = tolerance] and his patience, since you do not know that God's friendliness is trying to lead you to repentance? 5 But by your stubbornness and by a heart without repentance you gather for yourself anger on the day of anger, when God's righteous judgements will be revealed. 6 And he will give to everyone as his deeds are: 7 eternal life to [those] that seek glory and honor and an immortal state, by steadfastness in a good work, 8 but to [those] that love strife and do not follow the truth, but follow unrighteousness, [there] will be anger and wrath, 9 persecution and tribulation, upon the soul of every person that does evil, [the soul] of the Jew first and also that of the Greek; 10 but glory and honor and peace to everyone that does good, to the Jew firstly and also to the Greek.
11 For God does not heed faces [= is not partial]. 12 For those that sinned without law will also be undone without law, but all that sinned under law will be judged by law. 13 For [the ones] that hear law are not the just ones before God, but the ones that do [or, practice] law will be made just. 14 For whenever non-Jews that do not have law by nature do [the things] that the law says, these people, though they do not have [any] law, are a law to themselves. 15 They show that they have the matters of the law written in their heart, when their conscience witnesses with them and, in their own thoughts, [ore tien =] their heart/conscience tells them that they carry guilt or perhaps lack guilt 16 – on the day that God judges the secrets of men by the gospel which I have made known, through Jesus Christ.
	17 But if you, who are called Jew and rest upon law and praise yourself in God, 18 and you know his will and it is possible for you to judge what is good since you have received instruction out of the Law, 19 and you are sure that you are leading the blind, a light to [those] that are in darkness, 20 instructing those [that] lack understanding, a teacher of babes, having the shape of knowledge and of the truth in the Law – 21 you who instruct others, do you not instruct yourself? You who instruct: “Do not steal,” do you steal? 22 You who say: “Do not break marriage,” do you break marriage? You who say that you abhor idols, do you steal from temples? 23 You who praise yourself by the Law, do you by your breaking of the Law sully God's glory? 24 For as has been written: “Because of [-nen] you God's name is being blasphemed among the nations.”
	25 Indeed circumcision is beneficial if you abide by the Law; but if you break the Law, your circumcision has become lack of circumcision. 26 If, then, a person who is not circumcised keeps the Law's just commandments, will his lack of circumcision not be counted as circumcision?  
27 For the uncircumcised person who is so by nature, will by adhering to the law judge you who have the written scripture and the circumcision and yet have broken the Law. 28 For he is not Jew who is so on the outside; furthermore, circumcision is not that which exists on the outside, in the flesh. 29 But he is a Jew who is so on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart, by spirit and not by the letter. Such a person has his praise, not from men, but from God.
CHAPTER 3
What, then, is better for the Jew, or what [is] beneficial about the circumcision? 2 Numerous things, in every manner. Firstly God's words were placed in their keeping. 3 Then what? If some persons among them failed to believe, does their lack of belief perhaps make God's faithfulness without power? 4 By no means! But may God be found faithful, though every man will be found a liar, for [it] is written: “In order to show that you will be made just by your words and you will have victory when you are judged.”
5 But if our unrighteousness highlights God's righteousness [lit. makes God's righteousness easily seen], what are we to say? Surely God is not unrighteous when he shows his wrath? I am speaking like a man. 6 By no means! In [-nen] what other manner will God judge the world?
	7 And yet, if by my lie God's truth has become more prominent, to his glory, how is [it] that I am still being judged as a sinner? 8 What is to stop us from saying: “Let us to evil things, to bring [on] the good things!” Thusly some blaspheme about us, saying that we do speak so, but such  people will receive their just judgment!
9 Then what? Are we [excl. = we Jews] in a better place [= position]? Not at all! For beforehand we have said about Jews and Greeks alike that all among them are under sin, 10 as is written: “[There] does not exist [any] just man, not one; 11 [there] is nobody that has insight, [there] is nobody that seeks God, not a single person. 12 All have strayed, all together have become worthless [ú-mirwe 'un-precious'], [there] is nobody that does kindness, not a single person. 13 Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they have lied. Venom of snakes is behind their lips [dual], 14 and their mouth is full of cursing and of bitterness. 15 Their feet are swift to pour out blood. 16 Ruin and misery are on their ways, and the way of peace they have not known. 18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
	19 We know that everything that the Law says, it says to [those] that are under the Law, to stop every mouth, and the whole world will be culpable [*námima =' judgeable'] to God, for punishment. 20 Therefore by deeds of law [there] is no flesh which will be made just before him, for by law comes the knowledge of sin. 21 But now, without law, God's justness has been shown, as is being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets – 22 God's justness by faith in Jesus Christ, to all that believe. For no one is better than another, 23 since all have sinned and fall short of God's glory. 24 As a gift, by his grace, they are made just by the ransom in Jesus Christ, 25 whom God put as a guilt-offering through faith in his blood. Thus he was going to show us his righteousness, by forgiving the sins that happened in the past 26 while God showed patience, to show his righteousness at the time which is now, to be just also when he pronounces just [anyone] who is of the faith in Jesus. 
	27 Where, then, is the self-praise? [There] is not [any] place for it. By what law? That of acts? No, but by the law of faith. 28 For we reckon that man receives righteousness by faith, not by acts of law. 29 Or is God only of the Jews? Is he not also the God of people of the nations? Indeed he is also the God of people of the nations, 30 since God is one, who pronounces just the circumcised ones out of faith, and [those] that are not circumcised, by faith. 31 Do we thusly put away law by our faith? By no means, but we establish law!
CHAPTER 4
What, then, are we to say about Abraham, our father by the flesh? 2 For if Abraham was made just by deeds, he would have been able to praise himself, but not before God. 2 For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed in the Lord, and that was counted to him as justice.” 4 But to [the one] that works the reward is counted, not as grace, but as a debt. 5 But to [the one] that does not work, but believes in [Him] that makes just the godless one, his faith is counted as righteousness. 6 Thus David as well says about the joy of the man to whom God accounts righteousness without deeds: 7 “Happy are the people whose lawless deeds are forgiven and whose sins have been covered; 8 happy the person whose sin the Lord does not heed at all.”
	9 Did this joy come to [the] circumcised alone, or also to people that are not circumcised? For we say: “To Abraham his faith was counted as righteousness.” 10 How, then, was it counted to him? When he was circumcised, or while he was not circumcised? Not while he was circumcised, but while he was not circumcised! 11 For he received a sign, circumcision, as a seal of righteousness by the faith that he had while he still was not circumcised, for him to be father of all that have faith without circumcision, to cause righteousness to be counted to them, 12 and also father of circumcized ones, not only to those that adhere to circumcision, but also to those that follow Abraham our father in the path of faith in which he walked before he was circumcised. 
	13 For [it is] not by the Law Abraham or his seed has the promise about becoming heir to a world, but through the righteousness by faith. 14 For if those that adhere to law are heirs, faith has become empty and the promise has been abandoned. 15 For the law causes anger, but where [there] does not exist [any] law, [there] also does not exist crime. 
	16 Thus the promise is by faith, for it to be by grace, to make it firm for all the seed of Abraham, not only that which adheres to the Law, but also that which adheres to Abraham's faith. He is the father of all among us, 17 as has been written: “I have put you [as] father of numerous nations” – before God in whom he believed, who makes the dead alive and calls the things that do not exist as if they existed. 18 Beyond hope by hope he had faith of being father of numerous nations, as was said: “So your seed will be.” 19 And though his faith did not fade, he noticed his own body, which was like dead when he was close to a hundred years, and he also perceived how dead Sarah's womb was. 20 But by God's promise he did not falter in lack of faith, but he was made mighty by his faith, 21 and he was certain that he who gave the promise also had the power to do as he said. 22 Therefore that was “counted to him as righteousness”. 
	23 It was not written about him alone that that was counted to him, 24 but also about us. It will be counted to us – to the people who believe in him that raised Jesus our Lord from [the] dead. 25 He was given over because of our crimes and was raised for us to be pronounced just.
CHAPTER 5
Therefore, since we have been pronounced just by faith, may we have peace with God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 2 Through him we also have a gate of faith leading to the grace in which we now stand; and may we praise ourselves as concerns the hope of the glory of God. 3 Indeed not only that, but may we also praise ourselves concerning the persecutions, knowing that persecution gives endurance, 4 endurance leads to a tested condition, and a tested condition gives hope. 5 And the hope will not fail, for God's love has been poured out into our heart by the Holy Spirit that was given to us.
6 For indeed Christ, when we were still weak, died for godless men when the time came. 7 For one does not quickly choose to die even for a person who is just – or maybe one indeed dares to die for a person who is good. 8 But God shows us his love in this manner, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Since we have been made righteous by his blood, that much more we shall be saved by him from the wrath. 10 For if, when we were enemies, peace was established between us and God by the death of his Son, that much more we shall be saved by his life now that [lit. now when] we have peace with him. 11 And not just that, but we also bless ourselves in God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom peace has now been established for us. 13 For sin existed in the world before the Law, but sin is not counted against anyone when [there] does not exist [any] law. 14 And yet death had power from Adam [Atan] until Moses, also over the ones that did not sin in the manner of the crime of Adam, who is an image of [the one] that was going to come. 
	15 But the matter of the crime is not like the matter of the gift. For though numerous ones died by one person's crime, the grace of God and the gift by the grace of one person – Jesus Christ – were much more abundant to numerous ones. 16 Furthermore, [the] matter of the gift is not like the matter of [the one] that sinned. For the doom following a single crime brought a judgement of guilt, but the gift following many crimes leads to being made just. 17 For if by the one person's crime death had power by him, much more [those] that receive the abundance of his grace and the gift of righteousness will rule through that one person – Jesus Christ.
	19 For as by one crime all men were judged evil, in the same manner by one righteous deed all men are said [or, pronounced] just, to life. 19 For like numerous ones were made sinners since a single man broke the commands, so numerous ones are also made just since a single person heeded them. 20 But the Law came to make crime abundant. However, where sin was abundant, grace was still more abundant. 21 The purpose was that as sin ruled by death, so grace was going to rule by righteousness, bringing eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.
CHAPTER 6
What, then, are we to say? Are we to remain in sin, to make grace abundant? 2 By no means! We that died concerning sin, how will we still live in it? 3 Or do you not know that all among us that were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore we were put in a grave with him by his baptism. Thus, like also the Christ was raised from [the] dead by the glory of the Father, also we were going to walk in a new life. 5 And if we have come together with him in a death like his death, we shall also be with him in a resurrection like his resurrection. 6 For we know that our old man was crucified with him, to put away the body of sin, to stop us from being thralls under sin. 7 For [he] who has died has been freed from sin. 
	6 Furthermore, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 7 For we know that now, when the Christ has been raised from [the] dead, he does not die again; death does not [any]more have power over him. 10 For the death that he died, he died concerning sin a single time and forever, but the life that he lives, he lives for God. 11 In the same manner also you: count yourselves as dead to sin, but as living to God, in Christ Jesus.
	Therefore do not let sin rule your mortal body, for you to behave by its desires. 13 Furthermore, do not give your members [lit. body-parts] to sin as weapons of unrighteousness, but give yourselves to God as the living ones from [the] dead, also your members to God as weapons of righteousness. 14 For sin will not rule you, for you are not under law, but under grace.
	15 What follows? Are we to sin, since we are not under law, but under grace? By no means! 16 Do you not know that if you give yourselves to anyone as thralls, to do what he says, you are his thralls since you do what he says – perhaps thralls of sin, leading to death, perhaps thralls of obedience [lit. command-heeding], leading to righteousness. 17 But thanks be to God: You were thralls of sin, but you sincerely heeded the kind of instruction to which you were given over. 18 After you were freed from sin, you became thralls of righteousness. 
19 I speak to you in the manner of Men, since your flesh is weak. For like you made your body-parts thralls of uncleanness and lawbreaking, which led to more lawbreaking, now set your body-parts as thralls of righteousness, which will lead to holiness. 20 For when you were thralls of sin, you were free concerning righteousness. 21 But what was the fruit that you then had? Things of which you are now humiliated [/ashamed], for the end of those things is death! 22 But now, since you were freed from sin but have become servants to God, you have your fruit leading to holiness, and the end will be eternal wife. 23 For what sin pays is death, but God's gift is eternal life, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
CHAPTER 7
Or do you not know, my brothers – for I speak to [those] that know law – that the Law rules as lord over a man though[out] the entire time that he lives? 2 For a woman who has gotten married to a man is bound to her husband while the man is alive, but if her husband dies, the woman is freed from the law of the husband. 3 Thus, then, while her husband is alive, one was going to say that the woman has broken marriage if she gave herself to another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law, and she does not break marriage if she gets married to another man.
	4 Thus, my brothers, you as well became dead to the Law by the body of Christ, for you to be another's, he who was raised from [the] dead, for us to bear fruit to God. 5 For when we were in the flesh, the lusts of sin which were being strirred by the Law worked in our body-parts, causing us to bear fruit to death. 6 But now we have been freed from the Law, since we have died from that with which we were bound, for us to be servants in a new manner, by the spirit, and not in the old manner, by letters.
	7 What, then, are we to say? The Law is sin? By no means! But sin I did not know if not by the Law. For greed I did not now if the Law did not say: “Do not be greedy!” 8 But sin, having an opportunity by the commandment, created in me greed of every kind, for away from law sin was dead. 9 Indeed [there] was a time in which I was alive away from law, but when the commandment came, sin returned to life, but I died. 10 For the commandment which was for life, that I found was for death. 11 For sin, when it received an opportunity by the commandment, seduced me and killed me by it. 12 Therefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.
	13 Did that which was good cause death to me? By no means! But sin did so, causing death in me by [that] which is good, to reveal what sin really is [úcareo nasse: sin's true-being], and for it to be sinful beyond measure by the commandment. 14 For as we know, the Law is of the Spirit, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. 15 For what I work I do not understand. For [that] which I wish, that I do not do, but [that] which I hate, that is what I do. 16 But if [that] which I do not want is what I do, I assent with the Law that is it good. 17 But now [he] who works it is no more I, but sin which dwells in me. 18 For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, [there] dwells nothing good; for it is possible for me to desire, but it is not possible for me to work [that] which is good. 19 For the good that I want I do not do, but the evil that I do not want, that I do. 20 But if [that] which I do not want is what I do, [the one] who does it is no more I, but sin dwelling in me.
	21 This I find that [there] exists this law: When I wish to do what is proper, evil lies near to me. 22 Indeed I have joy in God's Law by my inner man, 23 but I see in my body-parts another law making war against my mind and making me a slave to the law of sin which exists in my body-parts. 24 Miserable man that I am! Who will save me from this body of death? 25 Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! Indeed I am a slave of the law of God by my mind, but by my flesh, of the law of sin.
CHAPTER 8
Thus [those] that are in Christ Jesus will not be judged evil. 3 For the law of the spirit which gives life in Christ Jesus has freed you [sg.] from the law of sin and of death. 4 For what the Law could not do, since it was weak by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in [that] which was similar to sinful flesh, and concerning sin. He judged sin evil in the flesh. 4 Thus the just command of the Law could become real in us that walk, not by the flesh, but by the Holy Spirit. 5 For [those] that are of the flesh heed the matters of the flesh, but [those] that are of the spirit, the matters of the spirit. 
To heed the flesh brings death, but to heed the spirit brings life and peace, 7 for [he] who heeds the flesh is hostile to God, for the flesh does not bow to God's law; indeed that is not possible for it. 8 Therefore [those] that are in the flesh are not able to please God.
	9 But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if God's spirit dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Christ's spirit, he is not his [= does not belong to him]. 10 But if the Christ exists in you, the body is indeed dead, by sin, but the spirit is life, by justness. 11 If the spirit of [him] that raised Jesus from [the] dead dwells in you, [he] who raised Christ Jesus [from] the dead will also made your mortal bodies alive, by his spirit that dwells in you.
	12 Therefore, brothers, we are indeed debtors, but not to the flesh, in order to live by the flesh. 13 For if you live by the flesh, you will die, but if by the spirit you kill the deeds of your body,, you will live. 14 For all that are being led by God's spirit, they are God's sons. 15 For you did not receive a thrall's spirit, again causing fear, but you received a spirit of being chosen as sons, the spirit by which we cry: “Abba, Father!” 16 The spirit itself is a witness with our spirit that we are God's children. 17 And if we are children, we are also heirs – indeed God's heirs, and heirs with the Christ, if we suffer with him, for us to receive also glory with him.
	18 Therefore I count the sufferings of this time as nothing compared to [lit. 'with'] the glory that will be revealed in us. 19 For with a burning desire Creation looks forward to the revealing of God's sons. 20 For Creation was put under [= subjected to] an useless [ú-aşea, un-beneficial] state, not by its own will but by [the One] who put it under that, although having a hope: 21 that also creation itself will be freed from being a thrall of corruption into the glorious freedom of God's children. 22 For we know how the entire creation is groaning together and is in pain together until now. 23 Not only that, but also we who have the first fruit – that is, the Spirit – we groan in ourselves, when we look forward to being chosen as sons – the release from our body by ransom. 24 For we were saved in this hope; but a hope that one sees is not hope, for when a person sees a thing, how does he have hope for it? 25 But if we have hope for that which we do not see, we are looking forward to it with endurance.
	26 In the same manner the Spirit also helps us when we are weak. We do not know what we would do well by requesting it, but the Spirit itself petitions for us, with unutterable words. 27 But he who searches the hearts know what the thought of the Spirit is, since by God's will it makes request for the holy ones.
	28 We know that God causes all things to work together for [those] who love God, for their good – the [ones] that are called for his purpose. 29 For the ones that he knew beforhand he also chose beforehand, for them to be fashioned according to the image of his Son, making him the first-born among numerous brothers; 30 but the ones that he chose beforehand, he also called, and the ones that he called, he also made righteous, and those that he made righteous, he also made glorious. 
	31 What, then, am I to say about these things? If God is with us, who will stand against us? 32 [The one] who did not have mercy even his own Son but gave him over for the good of all among us, how is [it] that he will [= would] not give us all other things? 33 Who will speak evil against [those] that God as chosen? God is [the one] who has spoken [= pronounced] them just; 34 who is [the one] that judge them evil? Christ Jesus is [the one] who died, or better, he is [the one] who was raised from the dead, who is at God's right hand, who also makes petition for us.
	35 Who will take us away from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or pressure or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword do so? 36 As has been written: “Because of you we are being slain throughout the whole day; we have been counted as sheep for slaughter.” 37 But in all these things we have the victory, by [the one] that loved us. 38 For I am sure that nothing – death or life or angels or lordships, or [the things] that are now or [the things] that will come, or powers, 39 or depth or every [/any] other created thing –  will be able to take us away from God's love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
CHAPTER 9
The truth I am telling in Christ – I am not lying, since my conscience is my witness with me, in the Holy Spirit – 2 that I have a great grief and a lingering pain in my heart. 3 For it is possible for me to wish that I were cut off as accursed from the Christ for the good of my brothers, my kin by the flesh, 4 who are Israelites, who were chosen as children and have the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the service [núromolie: servant-work] and the promises, 5 they that have the fathers and from whom the Christ has his descent by the flesh. May God, who is above all, be blessed forever! Amen!
	6 But the matter is not as if God's word has failed. For not all that have their descent from Israel are truly Israel. 7 Furthermore, all among them are not children by being Abraham's seed, but: “What will be called your seed will come through Isaac.” 8 That is, the children in the flesh are not truly God's children, but the children that exist by the promise are being counted as the seed. 9 For the word of promise was thus: “At this time I shall return, and [there] will be a son with Sarah.”10 And yet not only in that matter: The same happened when Rebecca begat twins by the same man, Isaac our father. 11 For when they still were not born, and before they did good or evil – to make God's purpose concerning the choice depend, not on deeds, but on [the One] who calls – 12 it was said to her: “The oldest will be a thrall to the youngest.” 13 Just as is written: “I loved Jacob, but Esau I hated.”
	14 Then what are we to say? Is there unrighteousness with God? By no means! 15 For he says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I shall have mercy, and I will show sympathy to whom I shall show sympathy.” 16 Therefore the matter hangs, not on [the one] who wishes or on [the one] that runs, but on Gods who shows mercy. 17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh:“For this purpose I have allowed you to remain, that in you I will show my power, and to make my name known on the entire earth.” 18 Thus he indeed shows mercy on [whomever] he shows mercy, but whom[ever] he wishes he makes hard.
	 19 Therefore you will say to me: “How is [it] that he still says that anyone has guilt? For who has been able to stand against his will?” 20 O man – who, then, are you who answers back to God? Surely that which has been formed will not say to [the one] that has formed it: “What is your reason for making me so?” 21 Or does the potter not have power over the earth [or, clay] to make from the same lump a vessel for a glorious purpose, and another for a purpose that is not glorious? 22 But suppose that God, though he has the power to show his wrath and to make his power known, with great patience allowed the vessels of wrath to remain, those that are made to be destroyed, in order to make known his abundant glory to the vessels of mercy, that he beforehand prepared for glory – 24 we whom he called not from the Jews alone, but also out of the nations.
	25 That is as he says in Hosea: “[The ones] that are not my people I will call my people, and [the one] who was not beloved, the beloved; 26 and in the place where [it] was said to them: 'You are not my people', there they will be called 'sons of the living God'.”
27 For Isaiah cries about Israel: “Though the number of the Children of Israel is like the sand of the sea, only a small remaining part will be saved. 28 For the Lord will do an accounting on earth, completing it and cutting it short.” 29 Furthermore, as Isaiah said beforehand: “If the Lord Sebaoth did not allow a seed to remain for us, we became like Sodom, and we were like Gomorrah.” 
	30 Then what are we to say? Non-Jews, through they did not pursue righteousness, have found righteousness – the righteousness that comes by faith. 31 But Israel, though they pursued a law of righteousness, failed to reach the [demands of] that law. 32 How so? For the reason that they pursued it, not by faith, but as by deeds. They stumbled [slipped, fell down] by the rock of slipping, as is written: “Behold, I put in Zion a stone of slipping and a rock of falling, but [the one] who believes in it will not be humilated.”
CHAPTER 10
Brothers, the desire of my heart and my petition for them to God is that they will be saved. 2 For I am a witness to them that they have a burning spirit for God, but not by knowledge. 3 For since they do not know God's righteousness, but try to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to [lit. put themselves under] God's righteousness. 4 For Christ is the end of the Law, for the purpose that everyone who believes will be pronounced just.
	5 For Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes by the Law: “The man who has done it will live by it.” 6 But the righteousness that comes from believing speaks so: “Do not say in your heart: Who will go up into heaven?” – that is, to bring the Christ down – 7 “or: Who will descend into the abyss?” – that is, to bring Christ up from [the] dead. 8 But what does it say? “The  word is near to you, in your mouth and in your heart” – that is, the word about the faith, which we make known. 9 For if with your mouth you indicate your belief that Jesus is Lord, and you believe in your heart that God raised him out of [the] dead, you will be saved.10 For with the heart one believes, which brings righteousness; by the mouth one indicates what one believes, which brings salvation. 
	11 For the Scripture says: “[The one] who has hope in him will not be humiliated.” 12 For the matter is not one for the Jew and another for the Greek,, but [there] is the same Lord over all, who is rich towards all that call upon him. 13 For “everyone who calls on [lit. by] the Lord's name will be saved”. 13 But how will they call to him in whom they do not believe? And how will they believe in him about whom they have not heard? And how will they hear if they lack anyone that makes known the gospel? 13 And how will they make it known if they are not sent? As is written: “How beautiful are the feel of [those] that bring good news about good things!”
	16 But all among them did not follow the gospel. For Isaiah says: “Lord, who believed that which people heard from us?” 17 Thus believing comes from that which one hears, and that which one hears comes by the speaking about Christ. 
	18 And yet I ask: Have they indeed not heard? Indeed “into all the earth their sound went forth, and their sayings to the ends of the world.” 19 But I ask: Did Israel not understand? Firstly Moses said: “I cause envy among you by what is not a nation; I cause you to have wrath by an unintelligent nation.” 20 But Isaiah is very bold and says: “I was found by [the ones] that did not seek me; I was made known to [the ones] that did not ask about me.” 21 But concering Israel he says: “Through the entire day [= all day long] I have spread out my hands towards a people disobedient and contrary [canwaracila ar váquetila = command-breaking and saying no].” 
I ask, then: Surely God has not abandoned his people? By no means! For also I am a man of Israel, of Abraham's seed, of the kin of Benjamin. 2 Eru did not reject his people, which beforehand he knew [or, recognized]. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Eliah, when he makes petition to God for Israel? 3“Lord, they have slain your prophets [or: heralds], they have torn down your altars, and I alone remains, and they are seeking my life.” 4 But what does the Word of God say to him? “I have let seven thousand men remain for me, that have not bent their knee to Baal.” 5 In this manner, therefore, also in this time [there] is a remaining part, by the choice of God's grace. 6 If it is grace, it is not by works [any]more; if not, the grace is not [any]more grace.
	7 What then? [That] which Israel is seeking, that it has not got, but the chosen ones have got it. The perception of the others became blunt, 8 just as [it] has been written: “God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, until this day.” 9 Furthermore, David said: “May their table be for them a snare and an entrapping and a reason to fall and a revenge; 10 may their eyes be made dark for them to fail to see, and always make their back bent!” 
	11 Therefore I ask: Did they slip to fall completely? By no means! But by their slipping [there] is salvation for the nations, to cause envy among them. 12 Now when their slipping brings riches to the world, and their being deprived brings riches to the nations, how much more will their full number do so!
	13 Now I am speaking to you, the non-Jews: Being what I am, indeed the apostle of the nations, I praise my ministry [núromolie: servant-work], 14 if [there] is a manner by which I can cause envy among [those] that are of my flesh and save some among them. 15 For if their being thrown away brings reconciliation [rainecarie, peace-making] to the world, what will their being received bring, if not life from the dead? 16 Furthermore, if the first portion is hallowed, then the whole dough is holy. And if the root is holy, so are the branches. 17 But if some branches were broken off, but you, though you are a wild olive tree, was put into the tree among them and received a part in the fat of the root of the olive tree, 18 do not praise yourself over the branches! But if you praise yourself over them, recall that you do not carry the root, but the root carries you.
19 Then you will say: “Some branches were broken off for me to be put into the tree.” 20 Well: By lack of faith they were broken off, but you stand by faith. Do not have lofty ideas, but fear! 21 For if God did not allow the branches that were there by their nature to remain, in the same manner he will not allow you to remain. 22 Behold, then, God's goodness and harshness: Towards [those] that fell [there] is harshness, but towards you [there] is God's goodness, if you remain in his goodness; if not, you all well will be cut off. 23 They as well, if they do not remain in their lack of faith, will be put into the tree, for God can put them there. 24 For if you were cut off from an olive tree which by nature is wild, and contrary to [ara = beside] nature you were put into the olive tree in the garden, how much more easy will it be for [those] that by nature have their place there to be put into their own olive tree!
25 For I do not wish that you, brothers, are to lack knowledge about this secret, to stop you from being wise in your own eyes: [There] is a part of Israel whose perceptions have become blunt until the full time when the fullness of the nations shall come in. 26 And thus all of Israel shall be saved, as has been written: “The Savior shall come from Zion and will turn away godlessness from Jacob. 27 And this is my covenant with them, when I put their sins away.” 28 Concerning the gospel they are enemies by reason of you, but concerning the choosing they are beloved, by reason of their fathers. 29 For God's gifts and calling are not things about which he will have second thoughts. 30 For as you in the past broke God's commands, but now have received mercy by their disobedience [canwaracie: command-breaking], 31 so they as well have broken the commands, which caused you to receive mercy, that they as well will receive mercy. 32 For God has shut them all up [from yor-] in disobedience, to have mercy on all among them.
	33 Behold how profound are God's riches and wisdom and knowledge are! How unsearchable his judgements, and how impossible to find his paths! 34 For “who knew the Lord's mind, and who instucted him?” 35 Or, “Who first gave to him and will receive a payment back?” 36 For from him and by him and to him are all things! To him be the glory forever! Amen.
CHAPTER 12
Therefore I urge you by God's compassion, brothers, that you will give your bodies as a living, holy sacrifice, pleasing to God: a service [núromolie, servant-work] with your understanding, 2 and do not be formed by this age, but be changed by the renewal of your mind, letting you judge what God's will is, the good and pleasing and perfect. 
	3 For by the grace given me I tell everyone among you: Do not think about yourself as higher than what it is necessary for you to think, but think in a manner giving health of mind, everyone as God has given him a measure of faith. 4 For as we have in one body many body-parts, but the body-parts do not do the same thing, 5 so we, though we are numerous, are one body in Christ, but one to one, one another's body-parts. 6 We have various gifts by the grace given us. For [the one] that has a prophecy it is necessary to use it by the measure of faith set aside to him, 7 to [the one] who has a ministry [núromolie, servant-work] it is necessary to work as a servant, for the teacher it is necessary to teach, 8 or [the one] whose work is to urge, for him it is necessary to urge; for [the one] who gives it is necessary to give richly, it ifor [the one] that stands before the congregation it is necessary to put his heart in his work; to [the one] showing mercy it is necessary to do so in joy!
	9 [Let] love be real! Abhor what is wicked; stick to what is good. 10 [Let] your brotherly love for one another be profound! May everyone show the others a respect greater than he asks for! 11 Do not be slow, abandoning the urgency; be burning in the spirit, be thralls for the Lord!
12 Have joy in the hope! Be steadfast in tribulation! Remain in prayer! 13 Give a part to the holy ones, as their needs are. Follow the love for strangers! 14 Bless [the ones] that persecute – bless and do not curse! 15 Have joy with [those] that have joy; be wailing with the wailing ones. 16 Be of the same mind, one towards the other; do not wish to be prominent, but be led by the lowly things. Do not become wise in your own eyes! [dual]
	17 Do not give anyone evil for evil! Bring forward boons before all men. 18 If that is possible, keep peace with all men, whenever that is possible for you. 19 Do not take revenge for yourselves, but give room for the wrath, for [it] is written: “Revenge is mine, says the Lord; I shall pay back.” 20 But “if your enemy is hungry, give him something to eat; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you gather fiery coals on his head.” 21 Do not be mastered by evil, but conquer evil by goodness.
May every person subject himself to [lit. place himself under] the higher authorities, for there is not any authority except by God; the authorities that exist have been put there by God. 2 Therefore [he] who stands against the authority stands against God's arrangement; the ones that have stood against it will receive judgement in themselves. 4 For [the ones] that rule are not a terror to the good deed, but to the evil one. You wish that it will not be necessary for you to fear the authority? Do [that] which is good, and you will receive praise from it, 4 for it is God's servant for your good. But if you do evil, then fear, for it does not carry the sword without reason. For it is God's agent, an avenging power that brings wrath upon [the one] that does evil.
	5 Therefore you have need to subject yourselves under the authority, not only by reason of the wrath, but also by reason of your conscience.
6 For that is also the reason for [-nen] which you pay taxes, for they are God's servants, ever heeding this purpose. 7 Give to all your debts to them: tax to the one that asks for tax, payment [paitie, paying] to the one that asks for payment, respect [áya = awe] to the one that asks for respect, glory to the one that asks for glory.
	8 Do not have a debt of a single thing to anyone, except to love one another, for [he] who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. 9 For the commandments: “Do not break marriage, Do not kill, Do not be greedy”, and all other commandments, have their sum in this word: “You are to love your neighbor as yourself.” 10 Love does not do evil against [one's] neighbor; therefore love is the law made true.
	11 Furthermore, do so since you know what the time is, that even now has come the time for awakening from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than what it was when we received faith. Therefore let us put away the deeds that are of darkness and let us put upon ourselves the weapons of light. 13 As at day, let us behave well, not in wild parties and drunken bouts [accasucier, over-drinkings], not in fornication and loose conduct, not in quarreling or envy. 14 But put on yourselves the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not make plans for the desires of the flesh.
CHAPTER 14
Receive the man that is weak in the faith, but not in order to judge his inner thoughts. 2 One person has faith to eat everything, but [the one] who is weak eats vegetables. 3 [The one] that eats is not to despice [the one] that does not eat, for [he] who does not eat is not to judge [the one] who eats, for God has received him. 4 Who [are] you to judge another's servant? For his own lord he stands or he falls. Indeed he shall stand, for the Lord is able to cause him to stand.
	5 One person judges one day as greater than another day; another person judges one day like all other days; may everone be wholly firm in his own mind. 6 [The one] who keeps the day, keeps it for the Lord, and [the one] who eats, eats for the Lord, since he gives thanks to the Lord; and [the one] who does not eat, does not eat for the Lord, and yet he gives thanks to God. 7 Indeed nobody among us lives for himself, and nobody dies for himself, 8 for if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Thus, if we live or we if we die alike, we are the Lord's. 9 And for this purpose Christ died and came back to life: to be Lord of dead ones and of living ones alike.
	10 But you, what is your reason for judging your brother, or what is your reason for despicing your brother? For all among us will stand before God's seat of judgement, 11 for [it] is written: “As I live, says the Lord, to be every knee will bend, and every tongue will praise God.” 12 Thus everyone among us will give a reckoning of himself to God.
13 Therefore let us not judge one another, but sooner [= rather] make this your judgement: do not put [any]thing before a brother that causes him to slip or fall. 14 For I know and have been by the Lord Jesus led to the belief that nothing is defiled in itself, except when a man counts a thing as defiled – to him it is defiled. 15 For if by food your brother has grief, you no more walk by love. Do not by your food undo the person for whom Christ died! 16 Therefore do not let anyone speak about your [pl.] goodness with scorn. 17 For God's kingdom is not eating and drinking, but justice and peace and joy by Holy Spirit. 18 For who thus is a servant to Christ. pleases God and has been found good by men.
	19 Therefore let us pursue the things that lead to peace and the things that build one another up. 20 Do not for [the sake of] food tear down what God has made! All things are indeed clean, but they are evil to a man who perceives it as a fall when he eats. 21 [It] is good not to eat flesh or to drink vine or to do anything that causes your brother to fall. 22 The faith that you have, keep it between yourself and God. Happy is the person who does not bring judgement upon himself by [that] which he pronounces good [or, approves of]. 23 But if his faith is not firm, he is beforehand judged evil if he eats, for he does not eat out of faith. Indeed everything that is not out of faith is sin.
CHAPTER 15
But the debt of us that are strong is to carry the weak states of [those] that are not strong, and not to please ourselves. 2 Let everyone among us please our neighbor, building him up. 3 For the Christ as well did not please himself, but as is written: “The harsh words of [those] who spoke harshly to you have fallen upon me.” 4 For all the things written beforehand were written for our instruction, for us to have hope by the steadfastness and by the comfort from the Scriptures.5 Now may God who gives steadfastness and comfort grant you to have the same state of mind among you that Christ Jesus had, 6 for you to praise with one mouth the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord. 
	7 Therefore receive one another, as the Christ received us, for the glory of God. 8 For I say that by God's faithfulness the Christ has been a servant to [those] that are circumcised, to make firm the promises to the fathers, 9 causing the nations to praise God by reason of his righteousness. As is written: “Therefore I will confess you among the nations, and to your name I will sing!” 10 And again he says: “Have joy, nations, with his people.” 11 And again: “Praise the Lord, all nations, and may all the peoples praise him!” 12 And again Isaiah said: “[There] will be the root of Jesse, and [he] who rises to rule nations; in him nations will put their hope.” 13 May God who gives hope fill all among you with joy and with peace since you believe, for you to have an abundance of hope, by the power of the Holy Spirit.
	14 Now I as well firmly believe concerning you, my brothers, that you are full of goodness, since you have been filled with all knowledge and know how to instruct one another. 15 But concerning some things I am writing to you in a manner very bold, as if to cause you to remember, by the grace given me from God. 16 Thus I will be Jesus Christ's servant for the nations, working as priest for God's gospel, for the purpose that the nations will be a pleasing sacrifice, hallowed by Holy Spirit.
	17 Therefore I may praise myself in Christ Jesus concerning God's things. 18 For I do not dare to tell of a single thing except [the ones] that Christ has done through me, to gain obedience among the nations – by word and by deed 19 by the power of signs and portents, by the power of Holy Spirit. And thus, from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Illyricum, I have made known the whole gospel about the Christ.
20 Thus I indeed make [it] my goal that I will not make known the gospel where Christ's name has been spoken before, to stop myself from bulding on another person's foundation. 21 But as is written: “The people to whom he was not made known shall see, and [the ones] that have not heard will understand.”
	22 Therefore I was frequently impeded from coming to you. 23 But now, since I lack more room in these regions where I can make known the gospel, and since I have longed for many years to come to you, 24 I have this hope: that when I go to Spain, it will be possible for me to see you when I pass by, and that you will help me to travel thither when I am in [some] measure filled [= content] with your company [lit. by being with you].
	25 But now I will go to Jerusalem to be a servant to the holy ones. 26 For [those] that are in Macedonia and Achaia thought well to give a part of their goods to the poor ones in Jerusalem.
27 To do so was indeed good in their eyes, and yet they were debtors to them, for if the nations have a part in their matters of spirit, they also owe to be servants for them with matters of the flesh. 28 Therefore, after I complete this and have brought these collected goods to them in safety, I will pass through your area on my journey to Spain. 29 But I know that when I come, I shall come having a full measure of blessing from Christ.
	30 Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the spirit, that you do all that you can with me in prayers to God for me, 31 for me to be delivered from [those] that do not believe in Judea, and that my service in Jerusalem will be to the liking of the holy ones [lit. will be good to the holy ones]. 32 Thus, when I come to you with joy, by God's will I will be renewed with you. 33 May God that gives peace be will all among you! Amen!
CHAPTER 16
I give you Phoebe our sister, who is also a deaconess of the congregation in Cenchreae. 2 Receive her in a manner worthy of the holy ones, and help her in every matter in which she has need of you, for she has protected numerous ones, me as well.
	3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, who have labored [dual] with me in Jesus Christ, 4 who [dual] put their own neck in danger for my life. To the, [dual] not I alone but also all the non-Jewish congregations give thanks. 5 Furthermore, greet the congregation of their [dual] house. Greet Epaenetus my beloved, who is a first fruit to Christ in Asia. 6 Greet Mary, who has done numerous things for you. 7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, who are [dual] of my kin and were with me in prison. They have a good name among the apostles, and were in Christ before me.
	8 Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in Christ. 9 Greet Urbanus, who has labored with me in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 10 Greet Apelles, who has been tested in the Lord. Greet the people in the house of Aristobulos. 11 Greet Herodion, who is of my kin. Greet the people in the house of Narcissus that are in the Lord. 12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who toil [dual] in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved one, for she has done many works in the Lord. 13 Greet Ruphus, the chosen one in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with then. 15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy ones with them. 16 Greet one another with a holy kiss! All of Christ's congregations greet you!
	17 Now I urge you, brothers, that you will keep your eye on those that cause splits and slippings from the teaching that you received, and turn yourselves away from them. 18 For such people are servants, not to Jesus Christ, but to their own bellies, and with fair words and having honey on their tongue they cause to stray the heart of the innocent ones.
	19 For your obedience is being noticed by all. Therefore you give me joy. But I wish that you will be wise about that is good, but innocent about what is evil. 20 The God of Peace will soon crush Satan under your feet [dual]. May Jesus our Lord's grace be with you! 21 Timothy, who labors with me, greets you, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, that are of my kin. 22 I, Tertius, who has written this letter, greet you in the Lord. 23 Gaius, who has received me and the entire congregation into his house, greets you. Erastus, governor of the city, greets you, and so does Quartus his brother. {24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all among you! Amen!} 
	25 To the One who can keep you firm by the gospel that I brought and by making known Jesus Christ, by the revelation of the mystery that has been kept in silence for eternities, 26 but now has been shown and made known by the writings of the Prophets among all the nations by the command of the Eternal God, to cause the faith to be heeded 27 – to God, wise alone, be the glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen!CHAPTER 1
Paul, called to be Jesus Christ's apostle through God's will, and Sosthenes our brother, 2 to God's congregation which is in Corith – to you that have been hallowed in Jesus Christ, called to be holy, with all that in every place are calling upon [-nen] the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, their Lord and our Lord.
	3 May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	4 I always give thanks to God for you, about God's greace given you in Jesus Christ, 5 that in everything you have been made rich by him, in every word and [all] knowledge, 6 since the witness of the Christ has been made firm among you. 7 Thus you do not lack a single gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ. 8 He will also make you firm until the end, for you to be perfect on the day of Jesus Christ our Lord. 9 God is faithful, by whom you were called to have a part with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. 
	10 Now I urge you, brothers, in [-nen] the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, that all among you will say the same thing, and that [there] will not be divisions among you, but that you will be one in the same mind and the same thought. 11 For [it] was told me about you, brothers, by the people from the house of Chloe, that there are quarrels among you. 12 I am talking about this thing, that everyone among you says: “I am for Paul“, “but I for Cephas“, “but I for Christ“. 13 The Christ is split. Surely Paul was not crucified for you? Or were you baptized in Paul's name? 14 I give thanks that I did not baptize any among you expect Crispus and Gaius. 15 Then you will not say that you were baptized in [-nen] my name. 16 Indeed I baptized also the family of Stephanas. Of the others I do not know that I baptized anyone.
17 For Christ sent me, not to baptize, but to make known the gospel, not with wisdom of speech, causing the cross of Christ to lack its power. 
	18 For [the] speech of the cross is foolishness to that that will be lost, but to us that are saved it is God's power. For [it] is written: “I will cause the wisdom of the wise ones to pass away, and the intelligence of the intelligent ones I will put away.“ 20 Where [is] the wise one? Where is the scribe? Where [is the one] who loves word-strife in this world? Has God not made the world's wisdom foolish? 21 For since, in God's wisdom, the world by its own wisdom did not know God, it was good in God's eyes that he would save [those] that believe by the foolishness that we make known.
	22 For Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek wisdom, 23 but we make known Christ crucified –  which turns Jews away and is foolishness to the non-Jews. 24 But to those that are called, to Jews and Greeks alike, he is Christ, God's power and God's wisdom. 24 For the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing of God is stronger than Men.
	26 For you behold his calling of you, brothers: that not numerous ones that were wise in the manner of the flesh were called, not numerous mighty ones, not numerous ones born as nobles. 27 But God chose the foolish things of the world, humbling the wise ones; and God chose the world's weak things, humbling the strong ones, 28 and God chose the ignoble ones [ú-arta-r] and [those] that were being despised – them that are nothing – to destroy them that seem important. 29 Thus [there] will not be [any] flesh that will praise itself before God. 30 But by him you are in Christ Jesus, who has been made God's wisdom to us, and righteousness and sanctification and ransom. 31 Thus, as has been written, '[He] that praises himself, may be praise himself in the Lord!'
CHAPTER 2
For I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come with beautiful words or wisdom when I made God's mystery known. 2 For I made the choice that I did not want to know a single thing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 3 For I can to you being weak and in fear and in great trembling, 4 and my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in a showing of spirit and power. 5 Thus your faith could be established, not on men's wisdom, but on God's power.
	6 Now we speak wisdom about those that are mature, but not the wisdom of this age, or that of [those] who rule in this age – that will be undone. 7 But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, which God established beforehand before the ages, for our glory. 8 This wisdom no one of [those] that rule in this age has known, for if they knew it, they did not [= would not have] crucify the Lord of glory.
9 But as is written: “[The things] that eye has not seen and ear has not heard, [the things] that a man's heart did not think, those God has prepared for [those] that love him.” 10 For to us God has revealed them, by his spirit – for the spirit searches into all things, also the profound things of God.
	11 For who among men knows a man's matters except the man's spirit which is in him? In the same manner nobody has known God's matters except God's spirit. 12 But we received, not the world's spirit, but the spirit which comes from God, for us to know the things that by grace are given us by God. 13 These things we also speak, not with words taught with man's wisdom, but with those taught by the spirit, while we judge the matters of the spirit with the words of the spirit. 
	14 But a man ruled by his nature does not receive [the things] that come from God's spirit, for to him they are foolishness, and he cannot know them, for they are inquired into in the manner of the spirit. 15 But a spiritual man [lit. man of spirit] inquires into all things, but he is inquired into by no one. 16 For “who has known the Lord's mind, that he can teach him?” But we have the mind of Christ.
CHAPTER 3
And to me, brothers, it was not possible to speak to you as to people of the spirit, but as to people of the flesh, as to babes in Christ. 2 Milk I gave to you, not firm food, for that you could not yet eat. Indeed you still fail to be able, 3 for you are still people of the flesh. For when [there] is enmity and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and walk as men do? 4 For when anyone says: “I am for Paul”, but another: “I am for Apollos”, do you not behave like men?
	5 What, then, is Apollos? Indeed what is Paul? Some servants by whom you believed, every person as the Lord allowed him. 6 I planted, Apollos poured water, but God gave the growth. 7 Thus, [he] who plants and [he] who pours are both nothing; God is [the one] that gives growth. 8 But [he] who plants and [he] who pours water are one, but every person will receive his own reward, by his labor. 9 For together we are God's servants. But you are God's field, God's building. 
	10 Now, by God's grace that has been given me, as a wise chief of construction I have put [in place] a foundation, but another builds on it. But may everyone heed how he builds on it. 11 For no one can put [in place] another foundation except that whis is put [down], which is Jesus Christ. 12 Now if anyone builds on this foundation – with gold, with silver, with jewels, with wood, with grass, with hay – 13 everyone's work will be shown, for the Day will show it [forth], and it will be revealed as by fire, and everyone's labor, of what kind it is, the fire itself will test.
14 If anyone's labor, which he has built on it, remains, he will receive reward. 15 If anyone's work is burnt [up], that will be lost to him, but he will be saved – though as through fire.
	16 Do you not know that you are God's temple, and that God's spirit dwells in you? 17 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him, for God's temple is holy, the temple that you are [or, constitute].
	18 May no one lie to himself: If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, may he become a fool, in order to become wise. 19 For this world's wisdom is foolishness to God, for [it] is written: “He seizes the wise ones in their own cunning,” 20 and again: “The Lord knows the thaughts of the wise ones, that they are empty.” 21 Therefore may no one praise himself in men, for you have all things. 22 No matter what [lit: not heeding what], Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the things that are now or the things that will come – everything you have, while you are of the Christ, and Christ is of God.
CHAPTER 4
May a man account us as Christ's servants, managing God's mysteries. 2 Furthermore, what one seeks in overseers is that everyone is being found faithful. 3 For me it is a very small matter to be examined by you or by human judges. Indeed I do not examine myself. 4 For I know nothing [damnable] against myself. And yet I am not thus shown [to be] just, but [the one] who examines me is the Lord. 5 Therefore do not  pass judement before the time, until the Lord comes, who will bring the hidden things of the dark into the light and also will make known the thoughts of the hearts, and then [there] will be praise for everyone from God.
	6 Here, brothers, I use myself and Apollos as examples, for your good. Thus, by heeding us [dual], you may learn this thing: “Do not go beyond the things written, to stop a person from elevating himself over another.” 7 For what exalts you above others? Indeed what do you have that you have not received? But if you received it, how is [it] that you praise yourself as if you did not receive it?
	8 Are you filled even now? Are you rich even now? Have you become kings without us? I wish that you did indeed become kings, for us to rule with you! 9 For [it] seems to me that God has put us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death, for we have been a spectacle [et-taná-ve, a showing forth] to the world, and to angels, and to men. 10 We are fools by the Christ, but you are intelligent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, while we lack glory. 11 Until this time we are hungry and thirsty and naked and beaten, without a home, 12 and we toil, laboring with our own hands. When we receive mockery, we bless; when we are being persecuted, we bear it; 13 when one speaks evil about us, we answer with friendly words. We have been as the world's refuse, a stain to be washed off all things, until now. 
14 I am not writing these things to humiliate you, but to show to you what is right, as my beloved children. 15 For if you had countless people instructing you in Christ, you indeed do not have numerous fathers [atar-li > atalli], for in the Christ Jesus I became your father by the gospel. 16 Therefore I ask of you: Walk in my path! 17 For [or 'by', -nen] this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will make you recall my ways in Christ Jesus, as I instruct in every place and every congregation.
	18 As if I am not coming to you, some have elevated themselves, 19 but I will come to you soon, if the Lord wishes. Then I will know, not the speaking of those that have elevated themselves, but their power. 21 What do you want? Am I to come to you bringing a rod, or bringing love and a gentle spirit?
CHAPTER 5
Indeed one hears about fornication among you, and such fornication that does not happen even among the non-Jews – a man has his father's wife! 2 And you think well of yourselves! You would have done better if you had grief, throwing this man out of your midst. 3 But I, though I am away in the body, but with you in the spirit, have judged even now – as if I were there – the man that has behaved so: 4 In [-nen] the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, when you are together and also my spirit is there having the power of Jesus Christ our Lord, 5 you are to give this man over to Satan. Thus his flesh will be destroyed, but the spirit will be saved on the Lord's day.
	6 You do not have a[ny] good reason for exalting yourselves. Do you not know that a small [amount of] leaven causes the whole dough to swell? 7 Take away the old leaven, for you to be a new dough which is without leaven. For our sacrifice of passover, Christ, has been slain. 8 Thus let us make a festival, not with the old leaven, also without leaven of evil and of wickedness, but having unfermented [alapalúne 'un-swollen'] breads of purity and of truth.
	9 In my letter I wrote to you: Do not remain among fornicators. 10 Not that you can turn yourselves fully away from fornicators, or from greedy people or people who worship idols. Then indeed it was necessary for you to pass out of the world! 11 But now I am writing to you: Do not remain with anyone called a brother who is a fornicator, or a person who speaks mockery, or who drinks too much, or who is a robber. Furthermore, do not eat with such a person. 12 For how is it necessary for me to judge [those] that are on the outside? Do not you judge [those] that are on the inside, 13 while God judges [those] that are on the outside? Send the evil person away out of your midst!
CHAPTER 6
Does anyone among you that have a strife against another dare to be jugded by unrighteous men and not by the holy ones? 2 Or do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you not worthy to judge the tiniest matters? 3 Do you not know that we will judge angels? Then why do you not [judge the] matters of this life?
4 If, then, you indeed have matters of this life about which you want a judgement, do you set as judges the men despised in the congregation? 5 I am talking to shame you. Do you then lack  [even] a single wise man among you who will know [how to] judge among his brothers, 6 but a brother has a lawsuit against a brother, and that before people who do not believe?
	7 Indeed you are defeated in the moment that you have lawsuits at all, one against the other.
 	9 How is [it] that you are not sooner [= why do you not prefer to be] wronged? How is it that you are not sooner deprived? 8 No, you wrong and make others deprived, and that your brothers! [or, and your brothers at that!] 9 Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not be heirs to God's kingdom? Do not err! Fornicators and people that worship idols or defile marriage, and men being kept for a purpose beside nature, or men that lie with men, 10 and thieves, and greedy ones, or people that drink too much, and people that speak mockery, and robbers, will not be heirs to God's kingdom.
11 And yet that is what some among you were. But you have been washed clean, but you have been hallowed, but you have been made just by the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, and by the Spirit of our God. 
	12 I may do all things, but all things are not beneficial. I may do all things, but I will not allow that I will be led under the power of a single thing. 13 Food for the belly, and the belly for food; but the Lord will destroy both. The body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. 14 But God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his might.
	15 But do you not know that your bodies are Christ's body-parts? Am I to take away the Christ's body-parts and make them a harlot's body-parts? By no means! 16 Or do you know that [the person] who has become one with a harlot is one body with her? For “the two”, he says, “will be one flesh”. 17 But [the one] who has become one with the Lord is one spirit with him. 18 Flee from fornication! Every other sin which a man can do is on the outside of his body, but [he] who fornicates is sinning against his own body. 19 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit in you, which you have from God? Furthermore, you do not possess yourselves, 20 for you were traded for a sum. Therefore give glory to God with your body!
CHAPTER 7
Concerning the things of which you wrote: Not touching a woman is for a man beneficial, 2 but to stop fornication it is necessary that every man has his own wife and every woman her own husband. 3 It is necessary for the man to give his debt to his wife [= to give his wife what he owes her], but it is also necessary for the wife to to the same to her husband. 4 The wife does not have mastery over her own body, but her husband has. In the same manner, the husband as well does not have mastery over his own body, but his wife has. 5 Do not make one another deprived, except when you are of one mind to be away from the other, for a time, to give yourselves [dual] opportunity for prayer. Then come together again, to stop Satan from tempting you [dual] since you cannot control your lust.
6 But this is a thing I allow, not a thing that I command. 7 But I wish that all men were like I am. And yet everyone has his own gift from God, one in this manner, another in that manner.
	8 Now I speak to those that have not married, and to the women whose husband has died: It is beneficial for them if they are still like I also am. 9 But if they lack self-control, let them marry, for if they marry, that is better than that they burn with desire.
	10 To the people that have married I give this command – and yet not I, but the Lord: A wife may not abandon her husband. 11 But if indeed she abandons him, it is necessary for her to remain without a man, or to make peace with her husband; and a husband may not abandon his wife. 
	12 But to the others I – not the Lord – say: If [there] is a brother having a wife who does not believe, and the woman by her free will wishes to live with him, he may not abandon the woman.13 And a woman having a husband who does not believe, and yet the man wishes to live with her by his free will, may not abandon her husband. 14 For the husband who does not believe is sanctified by the woman, and the wife that does not believe is sanctified by the brother. If not your children were unclean, but now they are holy. 15 But if the person that does not believe wants to go away, let him/her go away; a brother or sister is not bound in such circymstances but God has called you to peace. 16 For, wife, do you know whether you will save your husband? Or, husband, do you know whether you will save your wife?
	 Just as the Lord has portioned out to all, so may everyone walk as God has called him. Thus I command in all the congregations. 18 Was anyone called circumcized? May he not become uncircumcized. Was anyone called without circumcision? May he not become circumcized. 19 Circumcision is not important, and lack of circumcision is not important, but heeding God's commandments is indeed important. 20 May everyone remain in the condition in which he was called. 21 Were you called as a slave? Do not let that cause grief to you, but if it is also possible for you to become freed, instead seize the opportunity. 22 For anyone in the Lord who was called when he was a slave is Lord's freed [person]; in the same manner, [the one] who was called as a free person is Christ's slave. 23 You were traded to him for a sum; do not become slaves to men. 24 May everyone, not heeding the circumstance in which he was called, remain in it, before God.
	25 Concerning the virgins I do not have a command from the Lord, but I give my thoughts as a person who has received the mercy from the Lord that I am faithful. 26 Therefore, heeding the existing need, I think that this is the best for a man: that he remains as he is. 27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek releasing. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 28 But also if you did get married to a woman, you were not going to sin [by that]. And if a virgin got married, she was not going to sin [by that]. But [those] who do so will have tribulations in their flesh. But I try to save you from grief.  
29 But this thing I say, brothers: The remaining time is short. From now [on] it is necessary for [those] who have a wife to be as if they lacked a wife; 30 furthermore, for the wailing to be as if they were not wailing, and for [those] that have joy as if they lacked joy, and for [those] that trade to be as those that do not possess, 31 and for those that use the world to be as [those] that do not fully use it, for the form of this world passes away. 32 Indeed I wish that you will be free from concern. The man that does not get married to a woman gives his mind to the the matters of the Lord, how he will receive the Lord's praise. 33 But [he] who has not maried gives his mind to the things of the world, how he will receive his wife's praise, 34 and he is split. Furthermore, the woman that has not married, or the maiden, gives her mind to the matters of the Lord, allowing her to be holy in her body and her spirit alike. But the woman that has gotten married gives her mind to the matters of the world, how she can receive her husband's praise. 35 But this thing I am saying since that is beneficial for you, not to deprive you of liberty, but to cause you to have proper behavior, in which you adhere to the Lord without impediment.
	36 But if anyone thinks that his behavior towards his virgin is not proper, if she is beyond her bloom, and by need [it] will be so  – may he do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them [dual] marry. 37 But if anyone's heart is firm, not having [any] need, but he has power over his own will and has made the choice in his own heart that her he will keep a virgin, he will do well. 38 Thus [he] that marries off his virgin does well, but [he] that does not marries her off, will do better.
	39 A woman is obliged through[out] the whole time that her husband lives. But if her husband expires, she is free to get married to whom she wishes, though only in the Lord. 40 But she will be happier if she remains single, as the matter seems to me. Indeed I think that I also have God's spirit.
CHAPTER 8
Now about foods sacrificed to idols: We know that all among us have knowledge. Knowledge makes people haughty, but love builds them up. 2 If anyone things that he knows a thing, he still does not know it like it is necessary for him to know it. 3 But if anyone loves God, this person is known by him. 
	3 Now about the eating of foods sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that [there] does not exist [any] god except one. 5 For though [there] are they [or, those] that are called “gods”, in heaven or on earth, exactly like [there] are numerous “gods” and numerous “lords”, 6 [there] is for us a single God, the Father from whom all things are, and [there] is a single Lord, Jesus Christ by whom all things are, an we by him.
	7 And yet all do not have this knowledge. But some, whose habit until now concerns the idol, eat food as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is being defiled. 8 But food does not make us good in God's eyes. If we do not eat, we do not fall short, and if indeed we eat, we are not [any] better [for it].
9 But take heed that this right of yours will not in [any] way be a cause of slipping [or, stumbling] for the weak ones. 10 For if anyone sees you, the person having knowledge, lying by the table for a meal on a temple of the idols, will the weak person's conscience not be built up, to the point of eating foods sacrificed to idols? 11 By your knowledge the weak person will indeed be destroyed, your brother for whom Christ died! 12 But when you sin in this way against your brothers and wound their conscience that is weak, you are sinning against the Christ. 13 Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble [talta: slip], I will not ever eat flesh again, to stop myself from causing my brother to stumble. 
CHAPTER 9
Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 2 If I am not an apostle to others, indeed I am so to you, for you are the seal of my being an apostle, in the Lord.
	3 This answer I give to [those] that examine me: 4 We may eat and drink, it it not so? 5 We may bring a sister [= Christian woman] as wife, as do the others apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas, is it not so? 6 Or may Barnabas and I alone not be free from [secular] labour? 7 Who is ever a soldier on his own money? [= expence]. Who plants a garden of wines and does not eat of the fruit from it? Or who is shepherd of a flock and does not drink of the milk from the flock?
	8 Surely I do not speak so in a man's manner? Or does the law not also say these things. 9 For in the law of Moses is written: “You are not to stop a bull from eating while it is crushing the grain.” Are bulls important to God? 10 Or does he not speak so entirely for our good? Indeed for us that was written, for [it] is proper that [it is] in hope the man behind the plough shall work, and for the man that breaks the grain [it] is proper that he does so having hope that he will receive of the fruit of his labour.  
	11 If we have sown things of the spirit for you, is it a big thing if we shall reap things of the flesh from you? 12 If others have a part in this authority over you, do we not more so? And yet we have not used this power, but we are bearing everything, to stop ourselves from turning anyone away from the gospel about the Christ. 13 Do you not know that the servants of the holy things receive their livelihood from the Temple, and the servants beside the altar have their portion of the food sacrificed on the altar? 14 In the same manner the Lord also commanded that they that make the gospel known are to receive their livelihood by the gospel.
	15 But I have not used a single [one] of these things. Indeed I do not write these words in order to receive them. I would have wanted to die before I would have let anyone take away my reason for praising myself. 16 For if I make known the gospel, that is not for me a reason to praise myself, for a necessity has been put on me. Woe to me if I did not make known the gospel! 17 If I do so by my free will, I have a reward, but if I do it under compulsion, I still have a overseership put upon me.
	18 What, then, is my reward? This thing: that when I make the gospel known, I give it without reward [or: payment], not fully using the power that I have by the gospel.
	19 For though I am free from all, I have made myself thrall of all, in order to save the greater number [ambe rimbe, more numerous]. 20 To Jews I became a Jew, for me to gain Jews; to [those] that were under law I became as a person under law though I am not under law, to gain [those] that are under law. 21 To the people without law I became like a person without law – though I am not a person without law to God, but under the law of Christ – to gain those that lack law. 22 To the weak I made myself weak, for me to gain the weak. To all I have become all things, for me to gain at least [am-pitya-sse, at the smallest] some people. 23 But I do everything for the gospel, for me to have a part in it.
24 Do you not know that in a race, all the people run, but one alone receives the gift of winning? Run in a manner that will let you receive it! 
	25 Furthermore, every man that runs in a race shows control of himself in all things. They do so to receive a wreath that withers, but we a wreath that will not ever wither. 26 Therefore I indeed do not run in an uncertain manner; I beat [or, box] in a manner by which I do not just strike the air. 27 but I punish my body and lead it as a thrall, that I who have instructed others will not be turned away.
CHAPTER 10
I do not wish that you lack [= I do not want you to lack] this knowledge, brothers: that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea 2 and all were baptized into Moses by the cloud and by the sea; 3 and all ate the same food of spirit, 4 and all drank the same drink of spirit. For they drank from the rock of spirit that followed them, and that rock was the Christ. 5 But the greater number[lit. the more numerous persons] among them did not please God, for their corpses were scattered in the wilderness.
6 These things are put before you as examples, to stop us from wanting evil things, as they wanted them. 7 Furthermore, do not worship idols, like some among them did, as is written: “The people sat down to eat and to drink, and then they arose to play.” 8 Also, do not fornicate, as some among them fornicated, and they fell, twenty-three thousands in a single day. 9 Also, do not test the Lord, as some among them tested him and were destroyed by the serpents. 10 Also, do not be grumbling, as some among them grumbled and were slain by the Destroyer. 11 These things happened to them as examples, for they were written [down] to teach us about our dangers, we that have come to the end of the age.
	12 Therefore, [the one] who thinks that he stands, let him take heed that he does not fall. 13 You still have not met temptation beyond [that] which is normal for men. But God is faithful, and he will not allow that you are tested beyond [that] which you can bear, but with the temptation he will also bring the way out of it, to allow you to be firm.
14 Therefore, my beloved, free from idol worship. 15 I speak as to people having insight; judge for yourselves what I say. 16 The cup of blessing that we bless, does it not give us a part in Christ's blood? The bread that we break, does it not give us a part in Christ's body? 17 Since [there] is one bread, we are one body though we are numerous, for all among us have a part in that one bread.
	18 Look at [that] which is Israel in the manner of the flesh! Do not those that eat the sacrifices have a part with the altar? 19 What, then, am I do say? That that which has been sacrificed to an idol is an actual thing, or that the idol is an actual thing? 20 No, but I say that those [things] that the nations sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not wish that you are to have a part [or, a share] with the demons. 21 It is not possible for you to drink from the Lord's cup and from the demons' cup; it is not possible for you to eat from the table of the Lord and from the table of the demons. 22 Or do we want to arouse the burning spirit [zeal] of the Lord? Surely we are not stronger than him?
	23 Everything is allowed, but everything is not beneficial. Everything is allowed, but everything does not build up. 24 It is necessary that everyone heeds, not his own affairs, but also those of the other person.
	25 Everything that is being sold in a meat market you may eat; it is not necessary for you to ask questions by reason of your conscience, 26 for “belonging to the Lord [lit. the Lord's] are the earth and [that] which fills it”. 27 If anyone among [those] who do not believe calls on you and you wish to go, eat everything that is put before you, without questions by reason of your conscience. 28 But if anyone says to you: “This thing has been sacrificed,“ do not eat, 
by reason of [the one] who told you that, and by reason of conscience. 29 Conscience, I say, not your own, but that of the other person. For how is [it] that one is to judge my freedom by the conscience of another? TIL HIT
But if I am eating giving thanks to God, how is [it] that I am being blasphemed concerning that for which I give thanks? 31 Therefore, no matter [lá címala = not heeding] if you eat or you drink or do another thing, do everything for God's glory. 32 Keep yourselves from being causes of stumbling, to Jews and Greeks and God's congregation alike, 33 like I as well make all happy in all things – not seeking [that] which is beneficial to me, but [that] which will be beneficial for the greater number of people, for them to be saved.
CHAPTER 11
Walk my my path, as I walk in Christ's path.
	2 I praise you since in all things you keep me in mind, and you stick to the customs wholly as I gave them [over] to you. 3 But I wish that you know [= I want you to know] that every man's head is the Christ, and a woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head is God. 4 Every man who prays or speaks as a prophet without a covering on his head, humiliates his head, for that is the same thing as if his hair was cut off. 5 but every woman who prays or speaks as a prophet when her head is not covered, brings humiliation upon her head, for that is the same thing as if her hair was cut off. 6 And if a woman does not cover herself, it is necessary for her to cut off her hair, but if [it] is a humiliation for a woman to cut off her hair, it is necessary for her to cover herself.
	7 For a man does not do well if he covers his head, for he is God's image and glory, but the woman is the man's glory. 8 For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man; 9 futhermore, man was not created for the woman, but woman for the man. 10 Therefore for a woman [it] is proper to have on her head a sign of power, for the good of the angels.
	11 Also, in the Lord woman is nothing except by man; in the same manner, man is nothing except by woman. 12 For as the woman is out of man, so the man as well exists by the woman; but all things are out of God. 13 Judge for yourselves: Is it proper if a woman without cover prays to God?  
14 Does not nature [nasse, true-being] itself instruct you that if a man has long hair, that is to him a humiliation, 15 but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her as a veil. 16 But if anyone wants strife, that is not our custom, or the custom of God's congregations.
	17 But giving these commands I do not praise you, for you do not come together for good, but for evil. 17 Firstly, I hear that when you come together in the congration [there] exist divisions among you, and in part I believe it. 19 It is also necessary that there exist splits among you, in order to show who among you are trusty.
	20 Therefore, when you come together in a single place, you do not come to eat the Lord's evening meal. 21 For when you eat it, everyone has eaten his own evening meal beforehand, and  one person is hungry, while another is drunk. 22 Do you not have houses in which it is possible for you to eat and drink? Or do you despise God's congregation, and humiliate [those] who have nothing? What am I to say to you? Am I to praise you? In this matter I do not praise you.
	23 For I received from the Lord what I also let you receive from me: that in the night when he was given over, the Lord Jesus took a bread, 24 and after he gave thanks, he broke it and said: “This is my body, which is being given in your behalf. Do this in remembrance of me.” 25 After the evening meal he did the same with the cup, saying: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, at every time that you drink it, in remembrance of me.” 26 For on every occasion that you eat this bread and drink this cup, you make known the death of the Lord, until he comes.
	27 Thus everyone who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord without being worthy, will carry guilt concerning the Lord's body and blood.
28 It is necessary that a person tests himself, and thereafter he may eat of the bread and drink from the cup. 29 For [he] who eats and drinks without heeding the body, is eating and drinking judgement upon himself. 30 Therefore numerous ones among you are weak and sickly, and a sufficient number [= quite a few] have died. 31 But if we gave heed to ourselves, we were not judged. 32 But when we are being judged, we receive chastisement from the Lord, to stop us from being judged evil with the world. 33 Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat it, wait one for the other. 34 If anyone is hungry, it is necessary for him to eat in his house, or you will come together for judgement. But as concerns the other matters I will give orders when I shall come there.
CHAPTER 12
Now about the gifts of the spirit, brothers: I do not wish that you are to be ignorant. 2 You know that when you were of the nations, you were drawn away, being led to the dumb idols. 3 Therefore I wish that you know that nobody, when he is speaking by God's spirit, can say: “Jesus is accursed!”, and no one can say: “Jesus is Lord”, except by Holy Spirit.
	4 [There] exist numerous kinds of gifts, but the spirit is the same. 5 [There] exist numerous kinds of servant-work [ministry], but the Lord is the same. 6 [There] exist numerous kinds of work, but the same God works everything in everyone. 7 But the showing of the spirit is given to everyone for a beneficial purpose. 8 To one person is given speech of wisdom, to another speech of knowledge, as the same spirit leads him; 9 to another, faith from the same spirit, to another, gifts of healing by the sole spirit, 10 to another, working of wonders, to another, speaking as a Prophet, to another insight on the spirits, to another, [various] kinds of tongues, to another, telling what tongues mean. 11 But all these things are being worked by the one and the same spirit, distributing them as it wishes to every person.
	17 For just as the body is one, but has many parts, and all the bodyparts, though they are many, are a single body, so also is the Christ. 13 For indeed by one spirit we were all baptized into one body – not heeding [= no matter] if we are Jews or Greeks, not heeding if we are thralls or free ones. And all among us received the same spirit to drink.
	14 For the body indeed is not one part, but numerous ones. 15 If the foot were going to say: “Since I am not a hand, I am not a part in the body”, it is not therefore outside of the body. [*Hravo, possible gentive of hroa.] 16 And if the ear were going to say: “Since I am not an eye, I am not a part in the body”, it is not therefore outside of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where [would] the hearing [be]? If everything was hearing, where [would] the sense of smell [be]? 18 But now God has put the parts in the body – every single [one] among them – just as he wanted.
	19 If all among them were one part, where [would] the body [be]? 20 But now they are many bodyparts, and yet one body. 21 It is not possible for the eye to say to the hand: “Need of you I do not have,” or again the head to the feet [talu, dual]: “Need of you [letwa, dual] I do not have.”
22 [It] is much more true that [there] is a need for those body-parts that by their appearance are weak, 23 and the body-parts that we think less honorable, to them we give that [much] more abundant glory, and so our unseemly parts have more abundant beauty, 24 while our comely parts have need of nothing. And yet God put together the body, giving glory more abundant to the deficient part, 25 in order to stop the body from being split, but it is necessary for its parts to heed [or, care for] the others like they heed themselves. 26 And if one part has pain, all the other parts have the same pain; or if one part receives glory, all the other parts have joy with it. 
	27 Now you are the Christ's body, and all among you are parts in the whole. 28 And those that God has put in the congregation are, firstly, apostles, secondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers; then [those] that do wonders, then gifts of healing, helping services [molier, 'works'], leading services, kinds of tongues.
29 Surely all are not apostles? Surely all are not prophets? Surely all do not do wonders? 30 Surely all do not have gifts of healing? Surely all do not speak in tongues? Surely all do not have the gift of telling what the tongues mean? 31 But seek the greater gifts with a burning spirit! And yet I show you a surpassing way.
CHAPTER 13
If I speak in the tongues of men and angels, but I do not have love, I have been like a sounding piece of copper, or a cymbal making noise. 2 And if I have the gift of speaking as a prophet, and I know all the secrets and all knowledge, and if I have faith to command mountains to move, but I do not have love, I am nothing. 3 And if I give all my goods as food for others, and if I give away my body for it to be burnt, but I do not have love, that is not beneficial for me at all. 
	4 Love has patience and is gentle. Love does not have envy, it does not praise itself, it not haughty, 5 it does not behave in an unseemly manner, it does not seek its own things, it is not brought to anger. It does not keep a record of evil. 
6 It does not have joy in injustice, but has joy with the truth. 7 It bears everything, it believes everything, it has hope in everything, it endures everything. 8 Love does not ever fall away. If they are words of prophets, they will be put away; if they are tongues, they will cease; if it is knowledge, it will be put away. 9 For our knowledge is in part, and we speak as prophets in part, 10 but when the perfect [state] shall come, that which exists in part will be put away. 
	11 When I was a babe, I spoke as a babe, I thought like a babe, I judged like a babe; but now that I am a man, I have put away the things of the babe. 12 Now we see as if in a mirror, obscurely, but then we shall see from face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fully, as I am also known. 13 But now [there] remain faith, hope, love – these three – but the greatest among them is love.
CHAPTER 14
Pursue love, and yet with a burning spirit [şúle] seek the gifts of the spirit [faire], above all that you will be able to speak like prophets. 2 For [the one] who speaks in a tongue speaks, not to men, but to God, for [there] is no one listening, but he speaks secrets by the spirit. 3 But [he] who speaks as a prophet builds up and urges and comforts men with his speech. 4 [He] who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but [he] who speaks as a prophet builds up a congregation. 5 I wish that all among you will speak in tongues, but [it] is better if you will speak as prophets. [The one] that speaks as a prophet indeed is greater than [the one] that speaks in tongues – if he does not tell what his speech means, thus allowing the congregation to receive upbuilding. 6 But now, brothers, if I were going to come to you speaking in tongues, how was that [/how would that be] beneficial for you if I am did not speak to you with a revelation or with knowledge or with the word of a prophet or with a teaching? 
	7 If also [/even] things without life that give [out] sound, like a harp or a flute, cannot make the musical sounds different, how will one know what is played with the flute or the harp? 8 Indeed who will prepare himself for fighting if the trumplet gives an obscure sound? 9 In the same way you as well: If you do not with your tongue talk in a speech that people can understand, how will anyone know what is being said? Indeed you will speak into the air! 10 Although [there] are many kinds of languages [lambeler] in the world, [there] does not exist a single kind that means nothing. 11 If I do not know what the language means, I will be foreign to [the one] who speaks, and he will be foreign to me. 12 So you as well, since with a burning spirit you want the gifts of the spirit: seek to have them in abundance, in order to build up the congregation.
	13 Therefore it is necessary for the one who speaks in a tongue to pray that he will know [how to] tell what that means. 14 For if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit is praying, but my mind does not give fruit. 15 What am I to do? I will pray by the spirit, but I will also pray with my mind.
16 For if you give praise by spirit, how will the man that is sitting in the place of the ordinary person say “amen” when you give thanks, since he does not understand what you are saying? 17 You indeed give thanks in a good manner, but the other man is not being built up. 18 I thank God, I speak in tongues more numerous than all among you speak [in]! 19 And yet in the congreation I want to speak five words with my mind above ten thousand words in a tongue.
	20 Brothers, do not be children in understanding, but be babes in evil; and yet be perfect in understanding. 21 In the Law [it] is written: “With the tongues of strangers and with foreign people's lips I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.” 22 Thus tongues are a sign, not to [those] that believe, but to [those] that do not believe; but speaking as a prophet is not for [those] that do not believe, but for [those] that believe.
23 Therefore, if the entire congregation assembles in one place, and all among them speak in tongues, but people that lack knowledge or do not believe come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 24 But if all among them speak like prophets, and a person who does not believe or who lacks knowledge comes in, he is being shamed [/rebuked] by all, he is being examined by all, 25 the secrets of his heart are being revealed, and so, falling upon his face, he will worship God and openly say: “God is indeed among you!”
	26 Then what are we to do, brothers? When you assemble, one person has a holy song, one person has a revelation, one person has a tongue, one person knows [how] to tell what a tongue means. It is necessary that everything is to happen in order to build up. 27 And if people speak in tongues, it is necessary that they are not more than two or – as the highest permissible number – three. Let them [-lte] speak one after the other, and it is necessary that there is a person who tells what their speech means. 28 But if there is not anyone to give the meaning, it is necessary for him to be silent in the congreation and speak to himself and to God.
	29 And let two or three prophets give their words, and let the others judge what they are saying. 30 But if another receives a revelation while he is sitting there, it is necessary for the first one to be silent. 31 For you can speak as prophets one after one; thus all will be exhorted. 32 And it is necessary for the prophets to control their spirits. 33 For God is not a God whose paths are not arranged, but a God of peace.
	As in all congrations of the holy ones 34 it is necessary for the women to be silent in the congrations, for [it] is not permitted to them to speak, but it is necessary that they are in subjection [nu túre: under power], as the Law also says. 35 But if they wish to learn something, it is necessary for them to ask their own husbands in the home, for speaking in the congration is a humilation [a shame] for a woman.
	36 What? Was it from you God's word went out, or only as far as you it has reached? 37 If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or that he has the spirit, it is necessary for him to give heed to to the things that I am writing to you, for they are the Lord's command. 38 But if anyone lacks knowledge, without knowledge he is. 39 Therefore, brothers, with a burning spirit seek the gift of the prophet, and yet do not forbid the speaking in tongues. 40 But may all these things happen in a proper and arranged manner.
CHAPTER 15
Now I made known to you, brothers, the gospel that I gave to you, which I also received, in which you also stand, 2 by which you are saved, by the speech with which I made the gospel known to you, if you keep it – if you did not believe for nothing.
	3 For I gave over to you, among the first things, that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins as the Scripture says, 4 and that he was brought to his grave, and he has been raised up on the third day as the Scripture says, 5 and that he showed himself to Cephas, then to the twelve. 6 Thereafter he showed himself to more than [or = over] five hundred brothers, of whom the greater number remain until this day, though some are dead.
8 Thereafter he showed himself to Jacob, then to all the apostles, 8 but last of all he showed himself to me, as to a babe born before the time.
	9 For I am the smallest of the apostles, and I am not worthy to be called an apostle, for I have persecuted God's congregation. 10 But by God's grace I am who I am. And the grace that he gave to me was not for nothing, but I labored more than them all, and yet not I, but God's grace that is in me. 11 But not heeding [= no matter] if I or they did the work, this is what we make known [in preaching], and so you have believed.
	12 Now if concerning the Christ [it] is made known that he has been raised from [the] dead, how is [it] that [there] are some among you that say that there is no resurrection from [the] dead? 13 If [there] is no resurrection from the dead, Christ as well has not been raised. 14 But if Christ has not been raised, what we make known is actually empty [words], and our faith is empty.
15 Furthermore, we are also found as lying witnesses against God, for we have witnessed against God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise if [the] dead are not being raised. 16 For if [the] dead are not raised, the Christ as well has not been raised. 17 Furthermore, if the Christ has not been raised, your faith is for nothing; you are still in your sins. 18 Indeed also [those] that have died in Christ perished. 19 If in this life alone we have put our hope in Christ, we are among all men the most worthy of pity [*ofelme, sympathy].
	20 But the Christ has indeed been raised from [the] dead, a first fruit of [those] who have died. 21 For like death came through a man, also resurrection of [the] dead is through a man. 22 For like in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
23 But everyone in his own time: Christ the first fruit, thereafter [those] that are Christ at his coming, 24 then the end, when he gives over the kingdom to God and to the Father, after he put an end to all power and might. 25 For it is necessary for him to rule until God puts all enemies under his feet. 26 As the last enemy death will be put an end to. 27 For God “has put all things under his feet”. But when he says that all things have been put under his power, it is easy to see that he who put all things under him is not counted among them. 28 But when all things will be put under his power, then the Son himself will put himself under the power of [he] that put all things under him, to make God everything for all.
	29 If not, what will they do who are baptized for [the] dead? What is their reason for being baptized for them if [the] dead will by no means be raised? 30 Furthermore, what is our reason for putting ourselves in danger in every hour? 31 Every day I am dying – as true as it is possible for me to praise myself by means of you, brothers, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
32 If [it] was in the manner of men that I have fought against wild beasts in Ephesus, how was that beneficial to me? If [the] dead will not be raised up, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die! 32 Do not be made to err: If one remains among bad people, good habits will be marred. 34 Attain keenness of perception in a just manner and do not sin, for [there] are some that lack knowledge about God. I am talking to cause you to feel shame!
	35 But a person will say: “How will [the] dead be raised? What will be the kind of bodies that they come in?” 36 O unintelligent person! [That] which you sow is not made alive if it does not first die; 37 and that which you sow is not the body that will exist, but a naked seed – perhaps of grain, perhaps of another kind of plant – 38 but God gives it a body just as is good in his eyes, and to every seed its own body. 39 All flesh is not the same flash, but men have their kind, and [there] is another kind in cattle, and another kind of flesh in birds, and another kind in fishes. 40 And there are heavenly bodies and bodies on earth, but the glory of the heavenly bodies is of another kind, and not of the same kind as the glory of the bodies on earth. 41 The sun's glory is of its own kind, and the Moon's glory is another, and the glory of [the] stars is another; indeed [one] star is not like another star in glory.
	42 Thus [it] is also [with] the resurrection of [the] dead: It is sown in a destructible state; it is raised in a state beyond destruction. 43 It is sown without glory; it is raised in glory. 44 It is sown as a body of matter; it is raised as a body of spirit. 45 Thus [it] is also written: “The first man, Adam, became a living creature.” The last Adam became a spirit giving life. 46 And yet the first is not that which is of spirit, but that which is of matter; thereafter comes that which is of spirit. 47 The first man is out of the earth and made of dust; the second man is out of heaven. 48 Like the person made of dust, thus are also [those] that were made of dust, and like the heavenly person is, so are also [those] that are heavenly. 49 And just as we have borne the image of the person made of dust, we shall also bear the heavenly person's image.
50 But I say, brothers: Flesh and blood cannot be heir of God's kingdom; furthermore, that which is destructible will not possess that which is beyond destruction. 51 Behold! I am telling you a secret: All among us will not die, but all among us will be changed, 52 in a single moment, in the twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet shall be heard. For the trumpet will sound, and [the] dead will be raised in a state beyond destruction, and we shall be changed. 53 For [it] is necessary that this destructible [thing] puts on itself a state beyond destruction, and [it] is necessary for this mortal [thing] to put on itself an immortal state. 54 But when this mortal [thing] puts on itself an immortal state, then will occur the saying that is written: “Death has been undone forever! 55 Death, where [is] your victory? Death, where is your sting?” 56 The sting of death is sin, but the power of sin is the Law. 57 But thanks to God, for he gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord! 58 Therefore, my brothers, be faithful, firm – always doing an abundance in the work of the Lord, knowing that your work is not for nothing in the Lord.
CHAPTER 16
About the collection for the holy ones: As I commanded the congregations in Galatia, so you do as well! 2 May everyone among you, on every first day of the week, set aside money – the sum that it is possible for him to give. Thus, when I shall come, there will not be [any] need to do collections then. 3 But when I shall come there, I will send the men of your choosing to Jerusalem with letters, to carry your gift. 4 If it is possible for me as well to go, they shall go with me.
	5 But I will come to you when I have gone through Macedonia – for [it is] by way of Macedonia that I shall come – 6 and with you I will perhaps remain, or I will stay through the winter. Then you will be able to send me on my way again, to where I can go.
7 For I do not want to meet you now, passing through your region, for I have the hope that I will stay with you for [ter = through] a longer time, if the Lord allows. 8 But I stay in Ephesus until the Festival of Weeks [= Pentecost], 9 for a great door to work has been opened, and [there] are many that stand against me.
	11 When Timothy shall come, see that he will be free of fear among you, for he is doing the Lord's work, as do I. 11 Therefore allow no one to despise him. Send him on his journey in peace, for him to come to me, for I am waiting for him, with the brothers.
	12 Now about Apollos our brother: I urged him with many words to come to us, with the brothers, and yet his will was not to come now, but he shall come when it shall be possible for him.. Be awake, be firm in the faith, be manly, be mighty! 14 Cause all your affairs to happen in love.
	15 Now I urge you, brothers: You know that the family of Stephanas is the first fruit in Achaia, and that they appointed [panyane- “placed”] themselves to be servants to the holy ones. 16 Thus it is necessary also for you to subject yourselves [lit. put yourselves under] such people and all that work together and toil. 17 But I am happy since Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus are here, for though you are not with me, they have filled my need. 18 For they renewed my spirit and your spirit. Therefore receive such people well.
	19 The congregation in Asia greets you. Aquila and Prisca, with the congregation, greet you sincerely in the Lord. 20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
	21 This is my, Paul's, greeting, by my own hand. 22 If anyone does not love the Lord, may he be accursed! Maran atha! 21 May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you! 24 May my love be with all among you in Christ Jesus.Gospel of John
CHAPTER 1
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 Everything was created by means of him, and except by him not a single thing was created. [That] which was created 4 by him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not conquered it.
6 [There] arose a man sent by God; his name was John [or, Johannes]. 7 He came for a witness, that he was to  [Q: will] witness about the light, that all men were going to [Q: will] believe by means of him. 8 He was not this light, but he was to witness about this light.
9 The true light, shining for all men, was coming into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, but his own did not receive him. 12 But all who did receive him, to them he gave authority to be children of God, for they had faith in his name; 13 and they were born, not by blood or by flesh or by man’s will, but by God.
14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory, such glory as an only-born son has from his father; and he was full of grace and truth. 15 John witnessed about him; indeed he cried out: “This man is the one of whom I said: [He] who comes behind me is now in front of me, since he existed before me.” 16 For we all received out of his fullness, grace over grace. 17 For the Law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 God nobody has ever seen; the only-born Son who is in the Father’s bosom has made him known.
	19 This is the witness of John when the Jews sent some priests and Levites from Jerusalem to inquire of him: “Who are you?” 20 And he spoke openly and did not deny [it], but said openly: “I am not the Christ.” 21 And they asked him: “Then what? Are you Elijah?” And he said: “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered: “No!” 22 Therefore they said to him: “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” 23 He said: “I am a voice crying in the desert: Make the Lord’s way straight! – as Isaiah the Prophet said.” 24 The ones sent [forth] were of the Pharisees. 25 And they asked and said to him: “Then what is the reason that [yanen, “by which”]  you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?” 26 John answered and said: “I baptize with water; in your midst one is standing whom you do not know, 27 [the one] who comes after me, but I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his shoe." 28 These things happened in Bethany [Betania] beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
	29 On the following day he saw Jesus come to him, and he said: “Behold God’s Lamb who takes away the world’s sin! 30 He is the one of whom I said: Look! A man is coming who is now in front of me, for before me he existed. 31  I did not know him, but I came baptizing with water [so] that he was to be revealed to Israel.” 32 John also witnessed, saying: “I saw the Spirit come down out of heaven as a dove, and it remained on him. 33 And I did not know him, but [he] who sent me to baptize with water said to me: The one to whom you shall see the Spirit come down as a dove, he is [the one] who baptizes with Holy Spirit. 34 And I have seen it, and I have witnessed that he is the Son of God.”
	35 On the following day John again stood [forth] with two of his disciples, 36 and seeing Jesus walking he said: “Behold God’s Lamb!” 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they [-tte, dual]  followed Jesus. 38 But Jesus turned [Q: turned himself] and saw them [tú, dual] follow, and he said to them: “What do you [-ste, dual]  seek?” They said to him: “Rabbi” – which means teacher – “where are you staying?” 39 He said to them: “Come and see!” Therefore they came and saw the place where he stayed, and they remained with him on that day. [It] was around the tenth hour. 40 Andrew [Andreas], the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two disciples who [*yet, dual] heard [that] which John said and followed Jesus. 41 He found first his own brother, Simon, and said to him: “We [-mme, dual] have found [the] Messiah!” – which means Christ. 42 He led him to Jesus. When Jesus saw him he said: “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” – which means Peter [= Rock].
	43 On the following day he wanted to go to Galilee [Galilea]. Jesus found Philip and said to him: “Follow me!” 44 Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote: Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.” 46 But Nathanael said to him: “Can a good thing come from Nazareth?” 47 Jesus saw Nathanael come to him and said of him: “Behold a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit [vartie, betrayal]!” 48 Nathanael said to him: “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said: “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49 Nathanael answered him: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel!” 50 Jesus answered and said: “Since I told you that I saw you under the fig tree you believe? You will see some things greater than that.” 51 And he said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you: You will see heaven opened and God’s angels go up and down on the Son of Man.”
CHAPTER 2
On the third day [there] was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there. 2 Also Jesus and his disciples were invited [or “summoned”]  to the wedding.
	2 When they did not have more wine Jesus’ mother said to him: “They are lacking wine.” 4 But Jesus said to her: “Woman, what do I have [to do] with you? My hour still has not come.” 5 His mother said to those who served: “Do everything that he says to you!” 6 [There] stood there six water-vessels, according to the laws of purification of [the] Jews; each water-vessel could take two or three measures. 7 Jesus said to them: “Fill the water-vessels with water!” And they filled them brim full. 8 And he said to them: “Draw [some] from it and take it to the leader of the feast!” So they took it. 9 But when the leader of the feast tasted the water, which was changed into wine, but he did not know where it came from – though the ones who served knew – the leader of the feast called the bridegroom 10 and said to him: “Every other man first puts forth the good wine, and when people are drunk, the inferior. You have put aside  the good wine until now.” 11 Jesus did this in Cana of Galilee as the beginning of his signs and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
	12 Thereafter he and his mother and his disciples went down to Capernaum, but he did not remain there for [ter “through”] many days.
	13 Now [the] Jews’ Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves and the money-changers on their seats. 15 After making a whip of some ropes, he threw them all out together with the sheep and oxen; he poured out the coins [tyelpemittar “silver pieces”]  of the money-changers and overturned the tables. 16 And to those who sold doves he said: “Take these things away from here! Do not make the house of my Father a house of commerce!” 17 The disciples recalled that [it] is written: “The burning feeling for your house will devour me .”
	18 Then the Jews said to him: “What is the sign that you will show us, since you do these things?” 19 Jesus answered and said: “Destroy [nancara, “undo”] this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” 20 Therefore the Jews said: “This temple was built over [ter “through] forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?” 21 But he talked about the temple of his body. 22 Thus, after he was raised from [the] dead, his disciples recalled that he said this, and they believed what the Scripture says and the word that Jesus spoke.
	23 But when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the festival, numerous ones believed in his name, since they saw the signs that he did. 24 But Jesus himself did not open his heart to them, for he knew them all, and because he did not have [any] need that anyone was to witness about a man, for he knew what was in the man. 
CHAPTER 3
There was a man of the Pharisees; his name was Nicodemus, a ruler of [the] Jews. 2 This man came to him in the night and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for [there] is nobody who can do these signs if God is not with him.” 3 Jesus answered and said to him: “Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone is not born again, he cannot see God’s kingdom.” 4 Nicodemus said to him: “How can a person be born when he is old? Can he return to his mother’s womb to be born again?” 5 Jesus answered: “Truly, truly I say to you, if anybody is not born by water and by spirit, he cannot come into God’s kingdom. 6 What is born by flesh is flesh, and what is born by spirit is spirit. 7 Do not wonder because I said to you:  You [pl] must be born again. 8 The wind blows where it wants, and you [sg.]  hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is goes to. So is eveyrone who has been born by the spirit.”
	9 Nicodemus answered and said to him: “How can these things happen?” 10 Jesus answered and said to him: “Are you Israel’s teacher and you do not know these things? 11 Truly, truly I say to you [sg.], what we know we speak and what we have seen we witness [about], but you [pl.] do not receive our witness. 12 If I have told you [pl.] about the things of earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about the things of heaven? 13 Furthermore, nobody has gone up to heaven except [he] who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so [it] is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up, 15 that everybody who believes in him will have eternal life.
	16 For so God has loved the world, that he gave his only-born Son, that everyone who believes in that one shall not be destroyed, but shall have eternal life. 17 For God sent his Son, not for him to judge the world, but for the salvation of the world by that one. 18 [He] who believes in that one shall not be judged. [He] who does not believe has been judged even now, since he has not believed in the name of the only-born Son of God. 19 And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, but Men loved the darkness over the light, for their deeds [/works] are evil. 20 And [he] who does foul things hates the light and does not want to come to the light, [so] that his deeds will not be reproved. 21 But [he] who indeed does what is true comes to the light, [so] that [it] will be manifest that his deeds are done in God.”
	22 After these things Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean region, and there he remained with them and baptized. 23 John was baptizing in Aenon, near to Salim, since [there] was an abundance of water there, and people came and were baptized, 24 for John still was not [= had not yet been] thrown into prison.
	25 Then there was a quarrel between John’s disciples with a Jew concerning purification. 26 And they came to John and said to him: “Rabbi, the man who was with you beyond [the] Jordan, about whom you witnessed, look! he is baptizing and all are going to him.” 27 John answered and said: “A man cannot receive a single thing if it that is not given him from heaven. 28 You yourselves witness to me that I said: I am not the Christ, but I am sent in front of him. 29 [He] who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the bridegroom’s friend, when he stands hearing him, has great joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. Thus this joy of mine is full. 30 He will keep growing, but I will fade away.”
	31 [He] who comes from on high is over all others. [He] who is of earth is from earth, and he speaks of the things of earth. [He] who comes from heaven is over all others. 32 What he has seen and he has heard, about that he witnesses, but no one receives his witness. 33 [He] who has received his witness has put his seal on the faithfulness of God. 34 For [he] whom God sent speaks God’s sayings, for he does not give the Spirit by measure. 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 [He] who believes in the Son has eternal life; [he] who does not do as the Son says will not see life, but God’s wrath remains upon him.
CHAPTER 4
When the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard [Q: has heard] that Jesus was making and baptized [Q: is making and baptizes] disciples more numerous than the disciples of John – 2 though Jesus did not baptize, but his disciples did – 3 he went away from Judea and went again to Galilee. 4 But [it] was necessary for him to go through Galilee. 5 Therefore he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near to the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 6 There was Jacob’s spring. Thus Jesus, tired by the journey, sat down by the spring. The hour was around the sixth.
	7 A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.” 8 For his disciples were gone into the city to buy [lit. trade to themselves] food. 9 Therefore the woman from Samaria said to him: “How do you, who are a Jew, ask for a drink from me who is a Samaritan woman?” For Jews and Samaritans have nothing together. 10 Jesus answered and said to her: “If you knew God’s gift and [the] true-being of [him] who is saying to you: Give me a drink, you asked him, and he gave you living water.”
	11 She said to him: “Lord, you have no water-vessel, and the well is deep. From where, then, do you have the living water? 12 Surely you are not greater than Jacob our father, who gave us the well and who himself drank from it with his sons and his animals?” 13 Jesus answered and said to her: “Everyone who drinks of this water shall be thirsty again. 14 Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will by no means be thirsty, but the water that I will give him will be in him a spring of water that rises up into eternal life.” 15  The woman said to him: “Lord, give me this water, that I will not be thirsty and [it] will not be necessary for me to come here to draw water.”
16 He said to her: “Go, call your husband and come here!” 17 The woman answered and said: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You spoke well: A husband I do not have. 18 For you have had five husbands, and [the one] whom you have now is not your husband, Of this thing you spoke the truth.” 19 The woman said to him: “Lord, I see that you are a prophet. 20 Our fathers gave worship on this mountain, but you [pl.]  say that Jerusalem is the proper place for giving worship.” 21 Jesus said to her: “Believe my word, woman: The hour is coming when you [pl.] will not give worship on this mountain or in Jerusalem alike. 22 You give worship to what you do not know; we give worship to what we know, for salvation comes from [the] Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the father with spirit and with truth, for such worshippers the Father seeks. 24 God is a spirit, and [it] is necessary for [those] who worship him to worship with spirit and with truth.” 25 The woman said to him: “I know that [the] Messiah is coming, [he] who is called Christ. Whenever he shall come, he will tell us everything.” 26 Jesus said to her: “I who am speaking with you am he.”
27 Now his disciples returned, and they wondered because he spoke [/was speaking] with a woman; and yet nobody said: “What do you seek?” or “For what reason are you speaking with her?” [Mana i casta yanen… “what is the reason by which…”] 28 Thus the woman abandoned her water-vessel and went away into the city and said to the people: 29 “Come here, see a man who has told me everything that I have done! Maybe he is the Christ?” 30 They went out of the city and came to him.
31 At the same time the disciples urged him, saying: “Rabbi, eat.” 32 But he said to them: “I have food to eat that you do not know.” 33 Therefore the disiciples said, one to the other: “Did anybody bring him [some]thing to eat?” 34 Jesus said to them: “My food is that I do the will of [him] who sent me and complete his work. 35 Do you not say that [there] are still four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to you: Raise your eyes and behold the fields, that they are white for gathering the harvest. Even now 36 he who sowed is receiving his reward and is gathering produce [or “fruit”, yáve] for eternal life, [so] that he who reaps and he who sowed can have joy together. 37 For here this proverb is true: One has sown and another is reaping. 38 I sent you to reap [that] which you have not worked [on]. Others have worked, and you have entered into their work.”
	39 And in that city many of the Samaritans believe in him by the word of the woman who witnessed: “He told me everything that I did.” 40 Therefore, when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to remain with them; and he remained there for two days. 41 And numerous ones believed by [that] which he said, 42 and they said to the woman: “We do not believe [any]more because of what you said [quetielyanen, “by your saying”], for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the savior of the world.”
	43 After the two days he went away from there to Galilee. 44 But Jesus himself witnessed that in his own place a prophet does not receive honor [laitie, “praising”]. 45 Thus, when he came to Galilee, the people of Galilee received him, because they had seen the things that he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they too went to the festival.
	46 Thus he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he changed the water into wine. And [there] was a king’s servant whose son was ill in Capernaum. 47 When this man heard that Jesus had [Q: has] come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and asked of him that he was to come down to heal his son, for he was near to death. 48 But Jesus said to him: “If you [pl.] do not see signs and wonders, you do not believe at all.” 49 The king’s servant said to him: “Lord, come down before my boy dies.” 50 Jesus said to him: “Go! Your son is alive.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went away. 51 But when he was still on the way his slaves met him to tell him that his son was [Q: is] alive. 52 Therefore he asked them about the hour when he became better [ambe alwa, “more healthy”]. And they said to him: “Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever [úre “heat”]  left him.” 53 Thus the father knew that it happened in the same hour that Jesus said to him: “Your son is alive.” And he and his whole family believed. 54 That was the second sign that Jesus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee. 
CHAPTER 5
After these things there wsa a festival of [the] Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 2 In Jerusalem there is a pool called in Hebrew Bethsatha, having five columnades. 3 In them a multitude was lying: sick ones, blind ones, paralyzed ones and withered ones, waiting for a stirring of the water. 4 For from time to time an angel of the Lord came down into the pool, causing a stirring of the water, and anyone who went first into the pool after the disturbance of the water was healed from every kind of illness that he had. 5 But [there] was  a man there having had his illness for [locative] thirty-eight years. 6 Seeing this man lie there, and knowing that already he was [Q: is ] ill for a long time, Jesus said to him: “Do you want good health?” 7 The sick man answered him: “Lord, I do not have a man to put me in the pool when the water is disturbed, and when I am coming, another goes down before me.” 8 Jesus said to him: “Rise, take up your bed and walk!” 9 And in the same moment the man received good health, and he lifted up his bed and began to walk.
	But that day was a day of rest. 10 Therefore the Jews said to the healed man: “This is a day of rest; carrying the bed is not allowed for you.” 11 But he answered them: “[The one] who gave me good health, he said to me: Take up your bed and walk.” 12 They said to him: “Who is the man who said to you, Take it up and walk – ?” 13 But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had gone away, since [there] was a crowd in the place.
	14 After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, now you have good health! Do not sin [any]more, [so] that something worse [ambe ulca, “more evil”] will not happen to you.” 15 The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was [the] one who gave him good health. 16 And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things in the day of rest. 17 But he answered them: “My father works until now, and so I am working.” 18 For this reason the Jews wanted still more to kill him, for not only did he break the day of rest, but he also called God his own father, making himself like God.
	19 Therefore Jesus answered and said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son cannot do a single thing by himself, but only [that] which he sees the Father doing. For anything which he does, that the Son also does in the same manner. 20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he does, and he shall show him deeds greater than these, [so] that you will marvel. 21 For as the Father raises [the] dead and makes them alive, so also the Son makes those he wants alive. 22 For the Father does not judge anyone, but has given all judgement to the Son, 23 that all will praise the Son as they praise the Father. [He] who does not praise the Son does not praise the Father who sent him. 24 Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who hears my word and believes in [the one] who sent me has eternal life, and he does not come to judgement, but has passed from death to life. 
	25 Truly, truly I say to you: The hour is coming, and it is now, when [the] dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and [those] who hear shall come to life. 26 For as the Father has life in [him]self, so he has given the Son to have life in [him]self. 27 For he has given him authority of judgement, because he is [the] Son of Man.  28 Do not feel wonder about this, because the hour is coming when all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice 29 and will come out, [those] who did good things in a resurrection [enortie “re-raising”] to life, but [those] who did vile things in a resurrection of judgment. 30 I do not do a single thng by [my]self; as I hear I judge, and my judgment is just, for I do not seek my own will, but the will of [him] who sent me.
	31 If I bear witness about [my]self, my witness is not true. 32 There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that his witness about me is true. 33 You sent some people to John, and he has witnessed about the truth. 34 I do not receive [any] man’s witness, but I say these things that maybe you will be saved. 35 That man was a burning and shining lamp, and for [ter, “through”] an hour you wanted to have joy in his light. 36 But I have the witness that is greater than that of John, for the deeds [or, works] that the Father has given me to complete – the deeds that I am doing – those deeds bear witness about me that my Father sent me. 37 Therefore, the Father who sent me, he has witnessed about me. You have not heard his voice or seen his shape, 38 and you do not have my word remaining in you. For [the one] that he sent – in him you do not believe.
39 You search the scriptures, because you think that by them you will have eternal life, and they are [the ones] that bear witness about me. 40 And yet you do not want to come to me, so that you will have life. 41 I do not want to receive glory from men, 42 but I know about you that you do not have love for God in you. 43 I have come in my Father’s name, but you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. 44 How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? 45 Do not think that I will speak about your crimes before the Father. [The one] who speaks about your crimes is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. 46 For if you believed Moses’ saying you believed mine [as well], for he wrote about me. 47 But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe in my sayings? 
CHAPTER 6
After these things Jesus went away crossing the Sea of Galilee, or Sea [of] Tiberias. 2 But a huge crowd followed him, because they saw the signs that he did on the sick. 3 Then Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples. 4 Now the Passover, the festival of [the] Jews, was near.
	5 When Jesus raised his eyes and saw a great crowd come to him, he said to Philip: “Where will we buy [lit. trade to ourselves] breads so that these may eat?” But this he said to test him, for he knew what he was going to do. 7 Philip answered him: “Two hundred denarii are not enough for breads sufficing for them, [so] that each person will receive a small piece.” 8 One of the dciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him: “[There] is here a small boy having five breads of barley and two fishes. But what are they for so many people?”
	10 Jesus said: “Make the men sit down.” [There] was much grass in the place. Therefore the men sat down, a number [of] around five thousand. 11 Then Jesus took the breads, and after giving thanks, he distributed them to the sitting people, and so also the fishes, all that they wanted. 12 But after they were filled [or, sated] he said to his disciples: “Gather the leftover pieces, that nothing will be lost.” 13 Therefore they gathered them, and they filled twelve baskets with pieces of the five breads of barley – the leftovers left over by [those] that had eaten.
	14 Thus, when the men saw the signs that he did, they said: “This man truly is the prophet who was to come into the world.” 15 Therefore Jesus, knowing that now they were going to come and take him to make him king, went away into the mountain, he alone. 
	When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, 17 and having entered a boat they were going over the sea to Capernaum. But now it was dark [literally: (there) was darkness], and Jesus still had not come to them. 18 Furthermore, the sea rose up, because a strong wind was blowing. 19 But having sailed around twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walk on the sea and come near to the boat, and they were afraid. 20 But he said to them: “[It] is I; do not fear!” 21 Therefore they were willing to receive him into the boat, and in the same moment the boat was by the land to which they tried to go. 
	21 On the following day the crowd that stood on the other shore of the sea saw that [there] was not there [any] boat. They had seen that [there] was [Q: is] not another boat except the one, and that Jesus did not go away in [-nen] it with his disciples, but his disciples alone had gone away. 23 But boats from Tiberias came to the place in which they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks. 24 Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus and his disciples alike were [Q: are] not there, they went into their boats and went to Capernaum to seek Jesus.
	25 When they found him on the other side of the sea they asked him: “Rabbi, at what time did you come here? [literally: what (was) the time when you came here?]” 26 Jesus answered them and said: “Truly, truly I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the breads and were filled [/sated]. 27 Work, not for the food that will pass away, but for the food that remains for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father, God, has set his seal.”
	28 Therefore they said to him: “What are we to do in order to do God’s work?” 29 Jesus answered and said to them: “This is God’s work, that you are to believe in [the one] whom he sent.” 30 Therefore they said to him: “What, then, are you doing as a sign, [so] that we will see it and we are going to believe in you? What are you doing? 31 Our fathers ate the manna [Hebrew: mán] in the desert, as is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.” 32 Therefore Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you: Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father indeed gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For God’s bread is [he] who comes down from heaven and gives light to the world.” 34 Therefore they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread!”
	35 Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. [He] who comes to me will not ever be hungry, and [he] who believes in me will not ever be thirsty. 36 But I have said to you: you have seen me, and yet you do not believe. 37 Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and [he] who comes to me I will by no means throw out, 38 because I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of [him] who sent me. 39 This is the will of [him] who sent me, that nothing will be lost to me of all that he has given me, but I will raise it up again at the last day.”
41 Then the Jews murmurmed at him because he said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” 42 And they said: “Is this man not Jesus son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How may he say: I have come down from heaven – ?” 43 Jesus answered and said to them: “Do not be murmuring among yourselves. 44 Nobody can come to me if the Father who sent me does not draw him, and I shall raise him up again at the last day. 45 For [it] is written in the Prophets: And all among them shall be taught by the Lord. Everybody who has heard from the Father and has learnt comes to me. 46 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except [he] who is from God; he has seen the Father. 47 Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who believes has eternal life.
48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the desert, and yet they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, that anyone can eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that comes down from heaven; if anybody eats of this bread he will live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.” 
	52 Therefore the Jews quarreled one with the other, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 Thus Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves. 54 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up again at the last day. 55 For my flesh is real food, and my blood is a real drink. 56 [He] who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father sent me and I have life by the Father, so also [he] who eats me will have life by me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your fathers ate and yet died. [He] who eats this bread will live forever.” 59 These things he said when he was teaching in a synagogue in Capernaum.
	60 Therefore numerous ones of his disciples, when they heard this, said: “This saying is hard; who can listen to it?” 61 But Jesus, knowing by himself that his disiciples murmured about this, said to them: “Does this disturb you? 62 What, then, if you will see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 The spirit is what gives life; the flesh does nothing beneficial. The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. 64 But [there] are among you some people who do not believe.” For from the beginning Jesus knew [those] who did not believe and who was the one who was to betray him. 65 And he said: “For this reason I have said to you: Nobody can come to me if that is not given him by the Father.”
	66 Thereafter numerous ones of his disciples went away to the things behind them and did not want to walk with him [any]more. 67 Therefore Jesus said to the twelve: “Do you not want to go away, you too?” 68 Simon Peter answered him: “Lord, to whom are we to go? You have sayings of eternal life, 69 and we have believed and we know that you are the Holy One of God.” 70 Jesus answered them: “Have I not chosen you twelve? And among you one is a devil!” 71 He talked about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For this man, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.  
CHAPTER 7 
And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he did not want to walk in Judea, since the Jews sought to kill him. 2 But the festival of [the] Jews, the Feast of Leaf-huts, was near. 3 Therefore his brothers said to him: “Go away from here and go into Judea, that also your disciples will see the deeds that you do! 4 For nobody does anything secretly if he seeks to be known. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world!”  6 Therefore Jesus said to them: “My hour still has not come, but to you the hour is always ready. 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, for I witnessed about it that its deeds are evil. 8 You go up to the festival! I do not go up to this festival, for my hour still has not come.” 9 After saying these things to them he remained in Galilee.
	10 But after his brothers went to the festival, he too went up, not openly, but secretly. 11 Therefore the Jews sought him at the festival and said: “Where is that man?” 12 And there was much murmuring about him among the crowds. Some people said: “He is a good man.” Others said: “He is not, but he causes the crowd to err!” 13 Of course [lit. “as (is) understood” = self-evident], nobody talked openly about him, for they feared the Jews.
	14 When half of the festival had passed, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. 15 Therefore the Jews were in wonder, saying: “How does this man know the Scriptures when he has not learnt lore?” 16 Jesus therefore answered them and said: “What I teach is not mine, but is of [him] who sent me. 17 If anybody wants to do his will, he shall know concerning the teaching if it is from God or if I speak out of myself. 18  [He] who speaks out of himself is seeking his own glory; but [he] who seeks the glory of the person who sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him. 19 Did not Moses give you the Law? But nobody among you does as the Law says. For what reason are you seeking to kill me?” 20 The crowd answered: “You are possessed by a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?” 21 Jesus answered and said to them: “One deed I did, and you were all in wonder. 22 For this reason Moses gave you the circumcision – not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers – and  you circumcise a man at a day of rest. 23 If a man receives circumcision on the day of rest, that the law of Moses is not to be broken, are you angry at me because I gave perfect health to a man on the day of rest? 24 Do not judge as you see, but judge justly!”
	25 Therefore some people from Jerusalem said: “Is not he the one that they are seeking to kill? 26 And look! he is speaking openly, and they say nothing to him. Surely the rulers have not really found that he is the Christ? 27 But we know from where this man is. When [the] Messiah shall come, nobody will know from where he is.”
	28 Therefore Jesus, when he taught in the temple, cried out and said: “Me you know, you know also from where I am. I have not come by myself, but [he] who sent me is true, he whom you do not know. 29 I know him, for from him I come, and he sent me.” 30 Then they tried to seize him, but nobody laid his hand on him, for his time still had not come. 31 But numerous ones of the crowd believed in him and said: “When the Christ shall come, surely he will not do deeds more numerous than [the ones] that this man has done?”
32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent some officers to seize him. 33 Therefore Jesus said: “I will still be with you a short time, before I shall go away to [the one] who sent me. 34 You will seek me, but you will not find me, for where I am you cannot come.” 35 Therefore the Jews said among themselves: “Where will this man go away to, that we will not find him? Surely he will not go away to [those] who are scattered among the Greek, in order to teach the Greek? 36 What does this saying mean that he said: You will seek me, but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come – ?”
	37 But on the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood up and cried out, saying: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me to drink! 38 [He] who believes in me, from his innermost part [there] will flow streams of living water, as the Scripture has said.” 39 But this he said about the spirit that [those] were to receive who believed in him. For still there was no spirit, for Jesus still was not glorified. 40 Therefore some of the crowd that heard these words said: “This person is indeed the Prophet.” 41 Others said: “This is the Christ.” But [there] were [those] who said: “Surely the Christ does not come from Galilee? 42 Does not the Scripture say that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?” 43 Therefore [there] was a split concerning him in the crowd. 44 But some people among them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him. 
	45 Therefore the officers returned to the chief priests and to the Pharisees, and they said to them:  “How [is it that] you are not bringing him with you?” 46 The officers said: “No man has ever spoken like this.” 47 The Pharisees therefore answered: “Sure you are not misled as well? 48 Has anyone among the rulers or Pharisees believed in him? 49 But this crowd that does not know the Law, they are accursed!”
	50 Nicodemus, one among them who had come to him formerly, said to them: 51 “Surely our Law does not judge a man unless one has first given him a hearing and knows what he has done?” 52 They answered him: “Are you too from Galilee? Search and see that a prophet will not be raised up out of Galiliee.” 53 Then they went away, everyone to his house.
CHAPTER 8
But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 At dawn he returned to the temple, and the whole people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. 3 But the scribes [ingolmor “loremasters”] and the Pharisees brought to him a woman [who had been] seized in adultery. Placing her in their midst 4 they said to Jesus: “Teacher, this woman has been seized in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded that we are to kill such women by throwing stones at them. What, then, do you say?” 6 They said this to test him, that they were to have a thing by which they could accuse him. But he bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger. 7 When they asked him persistently, he arose and said to them: “Let [him] who is without sin throw at her the first stone!” 8 And again bending down be wrote on the ground. 9 But [those] who heard this went away, one ofter one, the elders first, until he remained alone with the woman who stood in their midst. 10 Jesus arose and said to her: “Woman, where are they? Did nobody judge you?” 11 She said: “Nobody, lord.” Jesus said: “Also I do not [= Neither do I…] judge you. Go; from now [on] do not sin [any]more.”
	12 Then Jesus talked to them again, saying: “I am the light of the world. [He] who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” 13 Thus the Pharisees said to him: “You witness about [your]self; your witness is not true.” 14 Jesus answered and said: “Even if I witness about [my]self, my witness is true, since I know from whom I come and where I go away. 15 You judge by the flesh; I do not judge anyboy at all.  16 And yet, if I do judge, my judgement is true, since I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. 17 Furthermore, in your own Law [it] is written: The witness of two men is true. 18 I am one who witnesses about [my]self, and the Father who sent me witnesses about me.” 19 Therefore they said to him: “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “You fail to know me and my father alike. If you knew me, you knew also my Father.” 20 These sayings he spoke in the treasury when he taught in the temple. But nobody seized him, since his time still had not come. 
21 Thus he said to them again: “I go away, and you will seek me, and yet you will die in your sin. To where I go away you cannot come. 22 Therefore the Jews said: “Surely he will not kill himself? Since he says: To where I go you cannot come.” 23 But he said to them: “You are from the low [places]; I am from the high places. You are from this world; I am not from this world. 24 Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”
25 Therefore they said to him: “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “[I am] who I told you from the beginning. 26 I have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But [he] who sent me is true, and the things that I heard from him I speak in the world.” 27 They did not understand that he spoke to them about the Father. 28 Therefore Jesus said: “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing by myself [or, on my own initiative], but as the Father taught me I speak these things. 29 And [he] who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I always do [that] which is pleases him.” 30 When he said these things, many believed in him.
	31 Therefore Jesus said to the Jews that believed in him: “If you remain in my word, you are truly my disciples, 32 and you shall know the truth, and the truth will free you.” 33 They answered him: “We are Abraham’s seed, and we have not ever been anybody’s slaves. How can you say: You shall be free – ? 34 Jesus answered them: “Truly, truly I say to you: Everyone who does [or, commits] sin is a slave of the sin. 35 Furthermore, the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. 36 Therefore, if the Son frees you, you will indeed be free. 37 I know that you are Abraham’s seed; but you are seeking to kill me, for my word does not find [any] place among you. 38 [The things] that I have seen beside my Father I speak; and in the same manner you do [the things] that you have heard from your father.” 39 They answered him: “Our father is Abraham!” Jesus said to them: “If you are Abraham’s children, do Abraham’s deeds! 40 But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do so. 41 You do the deeds of your father.” They said to him: “We are not born by fornication; we have a single Father, God.”
	42 Jesus answered them: “If God was your Father, you loved me, for from God I have come forth and I am here. Furthermore, I did not come by [my]self, but he sent me. 43 How [is it that] do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot listen to my word. 44 You are of your father, the Devil, and you want to do your father’s desires. He was a manslayer from the beginning, and he did not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie he speaks out of his own [things], because he is a liar and the father of the lie. 45 But because I say to you the truth, you do not believe my word. 46 Who among you rebukes me about sin? If I speak truth, how [is it that] you do not believe what I say? 47 [He] who is from God listens to the sayings of God. Because of [-nen] this you do not listen, for you are not from God.” 
48 The Jews said to him: “Do we not say well [= rightly] that you are a Samaritan and possessed by a demon?” 49 Jesus answered: “I am not possessed by a demon, but I honor [or “praise”] my Father, and you dishonor me. 50 But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge. 51 Truly, truly I say to you: If anyone keeps my word, he shall by no means ever see death. 52 The Jews said to him: “Now we know indeed that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets, but you say: If anyone abides by my word, he shall by no means ever see death. 53 Surely you are not greater than Abraham our father, who died? Also the prophets died. What do you make [of] [your]self? 54 Jesus answered: “If I will give glory to myself, my glory is nothing. [He] who gives me glory is my Father, who you say is your God, 55 and yet you do not know him. But I know him. And if I said that I do not know him, I were like you – lying. But I know him, and his word I keep. 56 Abraham your father had great joy at the thought that he was to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.” 57 Therefore the Jews said to him: “You still do not have [an age of] fifty years, and yet you have seen Abraham?” 58 Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” 59 Therefore they picked up stones to throw them at him, but Jesus hid himself and went away from the temple.
CHAPTER 9
When he passed by, he saw a man blind from the womb. 2 And his disciples inquired of him: “Rabbi, who has sinned, this man or his parents, since he was born blind?” 3 Jesus answered: “This man did not sin,  or his parents, but this happened [so] that God’s deeds were to be revealed by means of him. 4 [It] is necessary for us to do the work of [him] who sent me while [it] is day; the night is coming when nobody can work. 5 While I am in the world, I am the world’s light.” 6 After he said these things, he spat on the ground and made a mud with the spit, and he put the mud upon the man’s eyes 7 and said to him: “Go, wash [your]self in the pool called Siloam” – which means Sent. And so he went away and washed himself, and he returned seeing. 
	8 Therefore the neighbors and [those] who formerly saw that he was [Q: is] a beggar said: “This man is [he] who sat begging, no?” 9 Some people said: “It is he.” Others said: “No, but he is like him in appearance.” The man said: “I am he!”
	10 Therefore they said to him: “How, then, were your eyes opened?” 11 He answered: “The man called Jesus made a mud and put it on my eyes and said to me: Go to Siloam and wash yourself. Therefore I went and washed [my]self, and then I could see.” 12 And they said to him: “Where is that man?” He said: “I do not know.”
	13 They brought the man who formerly was blind to the Pharisees. 14 But [it] was a day of rest on the day that Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. 15 So also the Pharisees asked him about how he received sight. He said to them: “He put a mud on my eyes and I washed [my]self, and I can see.” 16 Therefore some of the Pharisees said: “This man is not from God, since he does not keep the day of rest.” Others said: “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And [there] was a split among them. 17 Therefore they said to the blind man again: “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?” The man said: “He is a prophet.”
	18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him that formerly he was blind and had received sight, until they called his parents of the man who received sight. 19 And they asked them: “Is this person your son, who you say was born blind? How, then, [is it that] he can see now?” 20 Thus his parents answered: “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. 21 But how he can see now we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know.  Ask him! He is an adult man. He can speak for [him]self.” 22 His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for beforehand the Jews had come to an agreement [lit. had become of one mind] that if anyone confessed Jesus as Christ, he was to be excluded from the synagogue.  23 Because of this his parents said: “He is an adult man; ask him.”
	24 Therefore they called for a second time the man who formerly was blind and said to him: “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.” 25 But he answered: “If [/whether] he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I know, that after being blind I now see.” 26 Therefore they said to him: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” 27 He said to them: “I told you before, and you did not listen. What is the reason that you want to hear it again? Do you too want to become his disciples?” 28 And they abused him and said: “You are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses. 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but of this man we do not know where he is from.” 30 The man answered and said to them: “This is indeed a wonder, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes! 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anybody fears God and does his will, he listens to him. 32 From of old nobody has ever heard that anybody opened the eyes of one who was born blind. 33 If this man was not from God, he could do nothing.” 34 They answered him: “You were born wholly in sins, and yet you teach us?” And they threw him out.
	35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and having found him he said: “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” 36 The man answered: “And who is he, lord, that I can believe in him?” 37 Jesus said to him: “You have seen him; indeed he is [the one] who is speaking with you.” 38 Then he said: “I believe, Lord!” And he threw himself down before him. 39 And Jesus said: “For judgment I came into this world, that the blind will be able to see, and that the seeing will become blind.” 40 Some of the Pharisees that were with him heard these things, and they said to him: “Surely we are not blind as well?” 41 Jesus said to them: “If you were blind, you had no sin. But now you say: We see. Your sin remains.” 
CHAPTER 10
“Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who does not come in to the sheep through the door, but climbs up in another place, that person is a thief and a robber. 2 But [he] who comes in through the door is [the] shepherd of the sheep. 3 To him the door-watcher opens, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them outside. 4 When he has led his own outside, he walks before them, and the sheep follow him, since they know his voice. 5 A strange person they do not follow, but they flee from him, since they do not know the voice of strangers.” 6 Jesus spoke this comparison to them, but they did not understand [the things] that he said to them.
	7 Therefore Jesus said to them again: “Truly, truly I say to you: I am the door of the sheep. 8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. 9 I am the door; anyone who comes in through me will be saved, and he will go in and out and will find pasturage. 10 The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come that they will have life and they will have abundance. 11 I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd gives his life on behalf of the sheep. 12 The paid man, who is not a shepherd and [yeva =] of whom the sheep are not his own, sees the wolf come and flees – and the wolf seizes them and scatters them – 13 since he is a paid man and the sheep are not important to him. 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me, 15 as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I give my life on behalf of the sheep.
	16 I have also some other sheep, that are not among these sheep; them as well [it] is necessary for me to lead, and they will listen to my voice, and they will be a single flock, a single shepherd. 17 By this reason the Father loves me, since I give my life, that I can receive it back. 18 Nobody has taken it from me, but I give it by my own will. I have authority to give it, and I have authority to receive it again. The command about this I received from my Father.”
	19 Because of these words there was another split among the Jews. 20 Numerous ones among them said: “He is possessed by a demon and is out of his mind! How is [it] that you listen to him?” 21 Others said: “These are not the sayings of a demon-possessed man. Surely a demon cannot open the eyes of blind [people]?” 
22 At that time there was the festival of renewal in Jerusalem. It was winter, 23 and Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s columnade. 24 Therefore the Jews surrounded him and said to him: “How long will you keep us in uncertainty? If you are the Christ, tell us openly!” 25 Jesus answered them: “I told you, and yet you do not believe. The deeds that I am doing in my Father’s name, they witness about me. 26 But you do not believe, since you are not of my sheep. 27 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 28 And I give them eternal life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed, and nobody will snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all others, and nobody can snatch them out of the Father’s hand. 30 I and the Father are [nát, dual] one.”
31 Again the Jews picked up stones to throw them at him. 32 Jesus answered them: “I showed you many good deeds from the Father. Concerning what [or, which] of those deeds do you want to throw stones at me?” 33 The Jews answered him: “We are throwing stones at you, not concerning [any] good deed, but concerning blasphemy, and since you who are a man makes [your]self a god!” 34 Jesus answered them: “Is it not written in your Law: I said: You are gods – ? 35 If he called gods the people to whom God’s word came – and the Scripture one cannot put away – 36 do you say to me whom the Father hallowed and sent into the world: You blaspheme, since I said, I am God’s son – ? 37 If I do not do my Father’s deeds, do not believe what I say [quetienyar “my sayings”]. 38 But if I am doing them, and you do not believe my sayings, believe the deeds, that you will know and you will understand that the Father is in me and I [am] in the Father.”  39 Therefore they tried again to seize him, but he escaped out of their hands [máltalto, distributive dual in ablative].
40 And he went away again beyond Jordan, to the place where John baptized in the beginning, and there he remained. 41 And numerous [people] came to him, and they said: “John did not do a single sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.” 42 And many believed in him there. 
CHAPTER 11
[There] was a man who was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and Martha her sister. 2 The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill was the woman who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and dried his feet with her hair. 3 Therefore the sisters sent word to him, saying: “Lord, see! [he] whom you love is ill.” 4 But when Jeus heard it he said: “This illness is not for death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of Man will have glory by it.”
	5 Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6 But when he heard that he was [Q: is] ill, he remained for two days in the place where he was. 7 Thereafter, after this, he said to the disciples: “Let us go into Judea again.” 8 The disciples said to him: “Rabbi, a short time ago the Jews sought to kill you with stones, and you are going there again?” 9 Jesus answered: “[There] are twelve hours of a day, no? If anyone walks at day, he does not fall, since he sees the light of this world. 10 But if anyone walks at night, he falls, since the light is not in him.”
	11 He said these things, and then he said to them: “Lazarus our friend has lain down to rest, but I will go there to wake him up.” 12 Therefore the disciples said to him: “Lord, if he has lain down to rest, he will be well.” 13 Jesus spoke about his death, but they thought that he spoke about resting in sleep. 14 Therefore Jesus then said to them openly: “Lazarus has died; 15 and for your good I am glad that I was not there, that you will believe. But let us go to him.” 16 Therefore Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples: “Let us go, we too, that we will die with him.”
	17 Thus Jesus, when he came, found that Lazarus had already been lying four days in the grave. 18 Bethany was near to Jerusalem, like one and a half league from it. 19 Thus many of [the] Jews were come to Martha and to Mary to comfort them [tú, dual] about their [-tta, dual] brother. 20 Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus came, met him; but Mary remained in the house. 21 Thus Martha said to Jesus: “Lord, if you were here, my brother was not dead. 22 And yet I know that everything that you make petition about from God, God will give you.” 23 Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.” 24 Martha said to him: “I know that he will rise in the resurrection [enortie, “re-rising”] on the last day.” 25 Jesus said to her: “I [am] the resurrection and the life. [He] who believes in me, [even] though if he dies, shall come to life, 26 and everyone who is alive and believes in me shall not ever die. Do you believe this?” 27 She said to him: “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who was to come into the world.” 28 And after saying this she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly: “The Teacher is here, and he is calling you.” 29 She, hearing this, arose quickly and went to him.
	30 Jesus still had not come into the village, but he was still in the place where Martha met him. 31 When the Jews who were with Mary in the house to comfort her saw that she arose and went out [Q: she arises and goes out], they therefore followed her, supposing that she was going to the grave to weep there.  32 And so Mary, when she came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, fell before his feet, saying to him: “Lord, if you were here my brother was not dead!” 33 Thus Jesus, when he saw that she cried [Q: cries], and that the Jews who were with her cried [Q: cry], groaned in his spirit and was shaken. 34 And he said: “Where have you put him?” They said to him: “Lord, come and see.” 35 Jesus cried. 36 Therefore the Jews said: “See how he loved him!” 37 But some among them said: “Could not this man who opened the blind [man]’s eyes stop this man from dying?” 
	38 Thus Jesus, after groaning again in [him]self, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay before it. 39 Jesus said: “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead, said to him: “Lord, [by] now [there] is a stench, for he has lain there for four days!” 40 Jesus said to her: “Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see God’s glory?” 41 Then they took away the stone. Jesus raised his eyes and said: “Father, I thank you because you have heard me. 42 I know that you always hear me, but for the good of the crowd that is standing here I spoke, that they will believe that you sent me.” 43 And after saying this he cried out in a mighty voice: “Lazarus, come out!” 44 And the man having died came out, restrained on his feet and on his hands by wraps, and having a cloth bound over his face. Jesus said to them: “Release him and let him go!”
45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary and saw what he did believed in him. 46 But some among them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus did. 47 Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Council and said: “What are we to do, since this man does many signs? 48 If we let him continue so, all will believe in him, and [the] Romans will come and will take away both our holy place and our nation.” 49 But one among them, Caiaphas, who was the chief priest that year, said to them: “You do not know a single thing, 50 and you do not understand that it is beneficial for you that a single man is to die on behalf of the people, that the whole nation will not be undone.” 51 But that he did not say of himself, but because he was the chief priest, he spoke as a prophet that Jesus was destined to die for the nation, 52 and not only for the nation, but for him to be able to gather into one the Children of God that are scattered. 53 Therefore from that day they made plans to kill him.
54 Therefore Jesus did not [any]more walk openly among [the] Jews, but he went away from there to the land near to the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he remained with his disciples. 55 Now the Passover of [the] Jews was near, and many came up out of the regions to purify themselves.
56 Therefore they sought Jesus and said, one to the other: “What are you thinking? That he will not come to the festival at all?” 57 The chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew [Q: knows]  where he was [Q: is], it obliges for him to tell, for them to be able to seize him. 
CHAPTER 12
Thus Jesus, six days before the festival, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus whom Jesus raised from [the] dead. 2 Therefore they made for him an evening meal, and Mary served, but Lazarus was among those who lay by the table with him. 3 Then Mary took a pound of fragrant oil – genuine, most precious nard – and anointed Jesus’ feet and dried his feet with her hair. The scent of the fragrant oil filled the house. 4 But Judas Iscariot, one among his disciples, who was going to betray him, said: 5 “How [is it that] this fragrant oil was not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?” 6 He said this, not because the poor were important to him, but because he was a thief: Having the moneybox he took  [the coins] that were put in it. 7 Therefore Jesus said: “Do not hinder her! Let her keep it for the day when I shall be brought to my grave. 8 For the poor you always have with you, but me you do not always have.”
	9 When a huge crowd of Jews understood that he was [Q: is] there, they came, not solely because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he raised from [the] dead. 10 But the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, 11 since because of him many of [the] Jews went there and believed in Jesus.
	12 On the following day, when the huge crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming [Q: is coming] to Jerusalem, 13 they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. And they cried: “Hosanna! Blessed is [he] who comes in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel!” 14 But after finding a young ass he sat down on it, as is written: 15 “Do not fear, daughter of Zion! Look! Your king is coming, sitting on the colt [onna, child/offspring] of an ass.” 16 The disciples did not understand these things from the beginning, but when Jesus was made glorious , then they recalled how these things were written about him and that they did so to him.
	17 Thus [they] witnessed, the people that were with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from [the] dead. 18 Because of this the crowd, when they heard that he did this sign, also met him. 19 Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves: “You see that you can do nothing. Look! The world has gone behind him.”  
	20 [There] were some Greeks [or, Hellenes] among [those] who went up to worship at the festival. 21 Therefore they came to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked of him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” 22 Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.
	23 But Jesus answered them, saying: “The hour has come when the Son of Man will be glorified. 24 Truly, truly I say to you: If a grain of seed does not fall into the ground and dies, it remains the [/ that] single grain; but if it dies, then it bears much fruit. 25 [He] who loves his life will destroy it, but [he] who hates his life in this world will protect it for eternal life. 26 If anyone wants to serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. 27 Now my soul is troubled, and what am I to say? Father, save me from this hour! But for this reason I have come to this hour. 28 Father, glorify your name!” Therefore a voice came out of heaven: “I both glorified it and I shall glorify it again!”
	29 Therefore the crowd that stood there and heard it said that it was thunder. Others said: “An angel has spoken to him.” 30 Jesus answered and said: “This voice did not come for my good, but for yours. 31 Now this world is being judged, now the ruler of this world will be thrown out! 32 And I, when I shall be lifted up out of earth, will draw all men to me.” 33 But that he said to show the kind of death that he was going to die. 34 Therefore the crowd answered him: “We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever, and how may you say that [it] is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” 35 Jesus therefore said to them: “The light will be among you for a short while more. Walk while you have the light, or darkness will conquer you, for [he] who walks in the dark does not know where he goes. 36 When you have the light, believe in the light, that you will be sons of light.” 
	These things Jesus said, and he went away and hid himself from them. 37 But though he had done so many signs in front of them, they did not believe in him, 38 in order to fulfill the word that Isaiah the Prophet spoke: “Lord, who has believed what we have heard? And the arm of the Lord, to whom was it revealed?” 39 The reason why [yanen “by which”] it was not possible for them to believe is that again Isaiah said: 40 “I will make their eyes blind and their heart hard, that they do not see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn [Q: turn themselves], [so] that I would heal them.” 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke about him. 42 And yet many also of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they that they were not going to be excluded from the synagogue. 43 For they loved the glory of [or “from”, -llon] men more than the glory of [/from] God.
	44 But Jesus cried [out] and said: “[He] who believes in me does not believe in me, but in [him] who sent me, 45 and [he] who see me sees also [he] who sent me. 46 I have come as a light into the world, and everyone who believes in me shall not remain in the darkness. 47 But if anyone hears my sayings and does not heed them, I do not judge him, for I came, not to judge the world, but to save the world. 48 [He] who disregards me and does not keep my sayings has [something] that judges him. The word that I have spoken is what shall judge him in the last day; 49 since I have not spoken by myself, but the Father who sent me, he has given me command about what I will l say and I will speak. 50 And I know that his command is eternal life. Therefore, the things that I speak – as the Father has spoken them to me, so I speak. 
CHAPTER 13
Before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that now his time had [Q: has] come to pass away from this world to go to the Father, and after loving his own who were in the world, he loved them until the end. 2 They were eating the evening meal, and the Devil had beforehand put [it] into the heart of Judas Iscariot son of Simon that he was going to betray him. 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had [Q: has] given all things into his hands, and that he had [Q: has] come forth from God and was to go [Q: will go]to God, 4 arose from the evening meal and put away his raiments. He took a linen cloth and girded himself. Thereafter he poured water into a bowl, and he started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them with linen cloth with which he was girded. 6 Thus he came to Simon Peter. He said to him: “Lord, are you washing my feet?” 7 Jesus answered and said to him: “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand it after these things.” 8 Simon Peter said to him: “By no means will you ever wash my feet!” Jesus answered him: “If I do not wash you, you do not have [any] part with me.” 9 Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!” 10 Jesus answered him: “[He] who has washed himself does not have need that anything is to be washed except his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean – but not all.” 11 For he knew the man betraying him. Therefore he said: “You are not all clean.” 
	12 After washing their feet and taking his robes he laid down again by the table and said to them: “Do you know what I have done to you? 13 You say to me: Teacher and Lord, and you speak well, for that I am. 14 Therefore, if I, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, [it] is also your duty [rohta “debt”] that you wash one another’s feet. 15 For I have set for you an example, [so] that as I have done, you too will do. 16 Truly, truly I say to you: A servant is not greater than his lord, or a person sent [forth] than [the one] who sent him. 17 If you know these things, happy you are if you do them. 18 I do not speak of you all; I know [the ones] that I have chosen. But it happens to fulfill the scripture: [He] who ate my bread has turned his back on me. 19 From this moment I tell you before it happens; thus, when it shall happen, you will believe that I am he. 20 Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who receives anybody that I send receives me, and [he] who receives me, receives [him] who sent me.”
	21 After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and he witnessed and said: “Truly, truly I say to you: One among you will betray me.” 22 The disciples looked on one another, not understanding about whom he spoke. 23 Before Jesus’ bosom [there] lay one of his disiciples, whom Jesus loved. 24 Therefore Simon Peter gave a hint to that one and said to him: “Tell who [it] is that he is talking about!” 25 Thus the disciple, leaning towards Jesus’ chest, said to him: “Lord, who is he?” 26 Therefore Jesus answered: “He is [the one] to whom I will give the piece of bread that I dip.” After dipping the piece he gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot. 27 And after receiving the piece, then Satan entered him. Therefore Jesus said to him: “What you are doing, do it quickly!” 28 But nobody among [those] who were lying by the table knew the reason why [yanen “by which”] he said this to him. 29 And some thought, since Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him: “Buy [the things] that we have need of for the festival,” or that he was to [Q: will] give something to the poor. 30 Therefore, having received the piece, he went out in the same moment. And [it] was night.
	31 Thus, after he went out, Jesus said: “Now the Son of Man is being glorified, and God is being glorified by means of him. 32 If God is being glorified by means of him, God himself will also glorify him, and he will glorify him soon. 33 My children, I am with you for a little while more. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews: Where I am going away you cannot come, so I say also to you now. 34 A new command I give you: to love one another. Just as I have loved you, so you too are to love one another. 35 By this all shall know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”
	36 Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, where do you go away to?” Jesus answered: “Where I am go away you cannot follow me now, but you will follow after[wards].” 37 Peter said to him: “Lord, how [is it that] I cannot follow you now? I will give my life for you!” 38 Jesus answered: “Will you give your life for me? Truly, truly I say to you: A cock will by no means sound before you have denied me thrice.”
CHAPTER 14
“Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. 2 In my Father’s house [there] are many rooms. If not, I told you [so], since I am going away to prepare a place for you. 3 Furthermore, if I go away and prepare a place for you, I shall return and receive you to myself, that where I am you too will be. 4 And where I am going away you know the way.”
5 Thomas said to him: “Lord, we do not know where you are going away to. How do we know the way?” 6 Jesus said to him: “I [am] the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. 7 If you knew me, you knew also my Father. From this moment you know him and you have seen him.”
8 Philip said to him: “Lord, show us the Father, and that is enough [farya “suffices”] for us.” 9 Jesus said to him: “So long I have been with you [pl.], Philip, and yet you [sg.] do not know me? [He] who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you [sg.] say: Show us the Father – ?10 Do you [sg.] not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The things that I have spoken to you [pl.] I have not spoken out of myself, but the Father who remains in me is doing his deeds. 11 Believe me that I am in the Fatehr and the Father in me; if not, believe because of the deeds as such! 12 Truly, truly I say to you: [He] who believes in me, he will do also the deeds that I do; and he will do deeds greater than they [or, those], since I am going away to the Father. 13 And everything that you pray for in my name, that I will do, [so] that] the Father will be glorified by means of the Son. 14 If you pray for [any]thing in my name, I will do it.
15 If you love me, you will remain in my commandments, 16 and I will ask of the Father, and he will give you another helper that will be with you forever, 17 the Spirit of truth, that the world cannot receive, since it fails to see it and know it alike. You know it, since it remains in you and is in you. 18 I do not leave you orphaned. I am coming to you. 19 After a little while more the world will not see me [any]more, but you will see me, since I am alive and you shall be alive. 20 On that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you. 21 [He] who has my commandments and abides by them, he is [the one] who loves me. Furthermore, [he] who loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal [my]self to him.”
	22 Judas, not Iscariot, said to him: “Lord, what has happened, since you will reveal [your]self to us and not to the world?” 23 Jesus answered him and said: “If anyone loves me, he will abide by my word, and my Father will love him, and we [dual] will come to him and will dwell with him. 24 [He] who does not love me does not abide by my words, and the word that you are hearing is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
	25 While I remain with you I have spoken these things to you. 26 But the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father shall send in my name, he will teach you all things and will make you remember everything that I told you. 27 Peace I let remain with you, my peace I give you. I do not give it as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled or frightened! 28 You heard that I said to you that I am going away and I will return to you. If you loved me, you had joy because of my going to the Father, since the Father is greater than I. 29 And now I have told you before it happens, that, when it does happen, you will believe. 30 I will not talk much with you from now [on], for the ruler of the world is coming. And he does not have power over me, 31 but that the world will know that I love the Father, therefore I am doing according to the command that the Father has given me. Rise, let us go from here!” 
CHAPTER 15 
“I [am] the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator. 2 Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every [one] that bears fruit he cleanses, for it to bear more fruit. 3 You are already clean, by the word that I have spoken to you. 4 Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit if it does not remain in the vine, so you cannot [either], if you do not remain in me. 5 I am the vine, you are the branches. [He] who remains in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for away from me you can do nothing. 6 If anybody does not remain in me, he is thrown outside as a branch and becomes dry, and people gather those branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burnt. 7 If you remain in me and my sayings remain in you, pray for everything that you want, and it will happen for you. 8 My father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and show yourselves as my disciples. 9 As the Father has loved me and I have loved you, remain in my love! 10 If you abide by my commandments, you will remain in my love, as I have abided by the Father’s commandments and remain in his love.
	11 These things I have spoken to you, that my joy will be in you and your joy will be made full. 12 This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. 13 Nobody has a love greater than this, that a person gives his life for his friends. 14 You are my friends if you do what I command you. 15 I do not [any]more call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his lord does. 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you, and I have appointed you to go out and to bear fruit, and your fruit will remain, [so] that the Father will give you what you pray for in my name. 17 These things I command you, that you will love one another. 18 If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before you. 19 If you were a part of the world, the world loved its own. But because you are not a part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, for this [reason] the world hates you. 20 Recall the word that I spoke to you: A slave is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, you too they will persecute. If they have abided by my word, they will abide by yours also. 21 But they will do all these things to you because of my name, since they do not know [the one] who sent me. 22 If I did [or, had] not come and talked to them, they did [/would] not have [any] sin; but now they do not have [any] reason to give concerning their sin. 23 [He] who hates me hates also my Father. 24 If I had not done among them the deeds that nobody else has done, they did not have [any] sin; but now they have seen and they have looked at me and my Father alike.  25 But it happens in order to fulfill the word written in their Law:  They hated me without reason. 26 When the Helper shall come whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth, who comes forth from the Father, he will witness about me; 27 you as well will witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.” 
CHAPTER 16
“These things I have spoken to you that you will not be made to fall. 2 People will exclude you from the synagogue. Indeed the hour is coming when everyone killing you will believe that so he serves God. 3 But they will do these things since they do not know the Father or me alike. 4 But these things I have spoken to you that you will recall that I told you about them when their time comes. These things I did not say to you from the beginning, since I was with you. 5 But now I go away to [him] who sent me, and yet no man among you says to me: Where do you go away to? 6 But since I have spoken these things, grief has filled your heart. 7 But I am telling you the truth: It is beneficial for you that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Helper will by no means come to you, but if I go away, I will send him to you. 8 For when he shall come, he will make the world believe, concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgement: 9 concerning sin, since they do not believe in me; 10 concerning righteousness, since I am going away to the Father and they will not see me [any]more, 11 concerning judgement, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
	12 I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 13 But when he shall come, the Spirit of truth, he shall lead you into the whole truth, for he shall not speak out of [him]self, but [the things] that he hears he will speak, and he will make known to you [the things] that will come. 14 He will bring me glory, since he will receive out of my [things] and will make them known to you. 15 All the things that the Father has are mine. Because of that I said that he receives out of my [things] and makes them known to you. 16 After a short time you will not see me [any]more, and after another short time you will see me again.”
	17 Therefore some of his disciples said, one to the other: “What does this mean that he said to us: After a short time you will not see me [any]more, and after another short time you shall see me again, and: Because I go away to the Father – ?” 18 Thus they said: “What does this mean that he says: a short time? We do not understand what he is saying.” 19 Jesus knew that they wanted to inquire of him, and he said to them: “Are you inquiring among yourselves about this, because I said: After a short time you will not see me, and after another short time you will see me again – ? 20 Truly, truly I say to you: You will have tears and you will be wailing, but the world will be happy; but your grief will be changed into joy.  21 A woman, when she is bearing a baby, has grief, because her time has come; but when she has borne the child, she does not [any]more recall her tribulation, because of her joy that a man has been born into the world.  22 So you too have grief now. But I will see you again, and your heart shall have joy, and nobody will take your joy [away] from you. 23 For in that day you will not ask me about a single thing. Truly, truly I say to you: Everything that you pray for from the Father in my name he will give to you. 24 Until now you have not prayed for a single thing in my name. Pray and you shall receive, that your joy will be full. 
	25 These things I have spoken to you in comparisions. An hour is coming when I will no more speak to you in comparisons, but openly I will tell you about the Father. 26 In that time you will not ask a single thing in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask [anything] of the Father concerning you [, either]. 27 For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God. 28 I have come forth from the Father and have come into the world. Furthermore, I go away from the world and go to the Father.
	29 His disciples said: “Look! Now you are speaking openly, and you do not speak [any] comparison! 30 Now we know that you know all things and you do not have need that anyone inquires of you. By this we know that you came forth from God.” 31 Jesus answered them: “Now you believe? 32 Look! The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you shall be scattered everyone to his own house, and me you will leave [hehta- “forsake”] alone, and yet I am not alone, since the Father is with me. 33 I have spoken these things to you, that by me you will have peace. In this world you have tribulation, but have courage! I have conquered the world.” 
CHAPTER 17
Jesus said these things, and raising his eyes to heaven he said: “Father, the hour has come; bring glory to your Son, that your Son will bring glory to you, 2 since you have given him lordship over all flesh, that he will give eternal life to all that you have given him. 3 This is eternal life, that they know you, the sole true God, and [the one] whom you sent, Jesus Christ. 4 I have brought you glory on earth, completing the work that you have given me to do. 5 And now, Father, make me glorious beside you with the glory that I had beside you before the world existed!
	6 I have revealed your name to the men that you gave me out of the world. They were your own, and you gave them to me, and they have abided by your word. 7 Now they know that all things that you gave me are from you, 8 for the sayings that you gave me I have given to them, and they have received them and indeed they know that you sent me. 9 I make petition concerning them. I do not make petition concerning the world, but about [the ones] that you have given me, since they are yours, 10 and all my things are your own and your own ones are mine, and I have been made glorious among them.
	11 Furthermore, I am not [any]more in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them for [the sake of] your own name that you have given me, that they will be one, like us. 12 When I was with them I protected them for [the sake of] your own name, and I have kept them, and no man among them is destroyed except [he] who was going to be destroyed, to fulfill the scripture. 13 But now I am coming to you, and I say these things in the world that they will have full joy in themselves. 14 I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, since they are not a part of the world, as I am not a part of the world.
	15 I ask [pray, petition] of you, not that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from evil. 16 They are not a part of the world, as I am not a part of the world. 17 Sanctify them with truth; your word is truth. 18 As you sent me into the world, I too sent them into the world. 19 And I sanctify myself for them, that they will be sanctified with the truth.
	20 I pray, not concerning them alone, but also concerning those who believe in me by their word, 21 that they will all be one, as you, Father, is in me and I in you, that also they will be in us [vetse, dual locative], [so] that the world will believe that you sent me. 22 Therefore, the glory that you have given me I have given them, that they will be one, as we are [vet nát, dual] one, 23 I in them and you in me, that they will be made perfect into one, that the world will know that you sent me and that you loved them, as you loved me. 24 Father, I wish that where I am, also [the ones] that you have given me will be with me, that they will see my glory that you have given me, because you loved be before the world was established. 25 Just Father, the world does not know you, but I know you, and these people know that you sent me. 26 And I have made your name known to them and I will make it known again, [so] that the love with which you loved me will be in them, and I in them.
CHAPTER 18
After saying these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the brook called Kidron, to a place where [there] was a garden, and he and his disciples entered it. 2 But also Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, since Jesus at numerous times met with with his disciples there. 3 Therefore Judas took the soldier host and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees and came there, bringing torches and lamps and weapons. 4 Thus Jesus, knowing all the things going to come upon him, went forward and said to them: “What do you seek?” 5 They said: “Jesus from Nazareth.” He said to them: “I [am] he.” Also Judas, who betrayed him, stood among them.
	6 But when he said to them: “I [am] he,” they stood back and fell to the ground. 7 Therefore he answered them again: “Whom do you seek?” They said: “Jesus from Nazareth.” 8 Jesus answered: “I have said to you that I am he. Therefore, if [it is] me you seek, let them go away” 9 – in order to fulfill the word that he said: “Among [the ones] that you gave to me no man is lost to me.”
	10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the chief priest and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. 11 But Jesus said to Peter: “Put your sword in the sheath! The cup that the Father has given me, am I really not to drink it?”
	12 Then the soldier host and the centurion and the officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him. 13 They brought him first to Annas, for he was the father of the wife of Caiaphas, who was the chief priest in that year. 14 Caiaphas was [the one] who said to the Jews that it was beneficial for them that one man died on behalf of the people.
	15 But Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the chief priest and came with Jesus into the courtyard of the chief priest, 16 but Peter remained on the outside by the gate. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the chief priest, came out and spoke to [the one] who watched the gate and led Peter inside. 17 Then the maid who watched the gate said: “Are not you too of the disiples of that man?” He answered: “I am not.”
	18 The disciples and the officers had made a coal fire, for [it] was cold, and they stood warming themselves. Also Peter stood with them warming himself.
	19 Then the chief priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 20 Jesus answered him: “I have spoken to the world openly. Always I taught in synagogue and in the temple, where all Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret. 21 For what reason are you inquiring of me? Inquire of [those] who heard what I said to them. Look! They know what I said.” 22 After he said these things, one of the officers that stood by him beat Jesus in the face and said: “Are you answering the chief priest so?” 23 Jesus answered him: “If I say what is bad, witness about the badness, but if I said what is right, what is your reason for beating me?” 24 Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.
	25 Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Then he said to him: “Are not you too among his disciples?” He denied it and said: “I am not.” 26 Among the slaves of the chief priest [there] was one of the family of the man whose ear Peter cut off, and he said: “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” 27 But Peter denied it again, and in the same moment a cock crowed [lit. “sounded”, as in the Greek]. 
	28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the governor. Now [it] was early. But they did not enter the palace of the governor, in order not to become unclean, but they might eat the pascal meal. Then Pilate came outside to them and said: “What is the crime that you are saying this man has committed?” 30 They answered him: “If this man was not a criminal, we did not turn him over to you.” 31 Then Pilate said to them: “You take him and judge him by your law.” The Jews said to him: “We may not kill anyone” 32 – in order to fulfill the word that Jesus spoke to indicate the kind of death that he was to die.
	33 Therefore Pilate went into the palace of the governor and called Jesus and said to him: “Are you the king of [the] Jews?” 34 Jesus answered: “Do you say this by yourself, or have others talked to you about me?” 35 Pilate answered: “Surely I am not a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests gave you over to me. What have you done?” 36 Jesus answered: “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom was of this world, my servants would have fought, that I would [Q: will] not be given over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.”
	37 Therefore Pilate said to him: “Thus you are a king?” Jesus answered: “You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this thing I have been born, and for this thing I have come into the world, that I am to witness about the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.” 38 Pilate said to him: “What is truth?”
	After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them: “I do not find [any] guilt in him. 39 But you have a custom that I release to you a man at the Passover. Do you wish, then, that I release to you the king of [the] Jews?” 40 Then they cried again, saying: “Not this man, but Barabbas!” But Barabbas was a robber. 
CHAPTER 19
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and flogged him. 2 And the soldiers made a crown of some thorns and put it on his head and threw a violet raiment around him, 3 and they came before him and said: “Hail, King of [the] Jews.” And they beat him in the face. 4 And Pilate went out again and said to them: “Look! I am bringing him out to you again, that you can know that I do not find [any] guilt in him.” 5 Therefore Jesus came out, bearing the crown of thorns and the violet raiment. And he said to them: “Behold the man!” 6 But when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried [out] saying: “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them: “You take him and crucify him, for I do not find [any] guilt in him.” 7 The Jews answered him: “We have a law, and by that law he is worthy of death, since he has made [him]self God’s son.”
8 Therefore, when Pilate heard this saying, he was more frightened, 9 and he went into the palace again and said to Jesus: “Where do you come from?” But Jesus did not give him [any] answer. 10 Therefore Pilate said to him: “Do you not talk to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?” 11 Jesus answered him: “You had no authority at all over me if it was not given you from on high. Because of this the man who turned me over to you has greater [ambe túra = more great] sin.”
	12 Therefore Pilate sought a way of releasing him. But the Jews shouted, saying: “If you relase this man, you are not a friend of the High King [or, Emperor]! Anyone who makes [him]self a king rises up against the High King!” 13 Therefore Pilate, after hearing these things, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on his judge[ment] seat in a place called the Stone Court, or in Hebrew Gabbatha. 14 Now [it] was the preparation of the Passover; [it] was around the night hour. And he said to the Jews: “Behold your king!” 15 But they cried: “Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them: “Am I to crucify your king?” The chief priests answered: “We do not have [any] king except the High King!” 16 Then, therefore, he gave Jesus over to them for crucifixion.
	So they took Jesus. 17 Carrying his cross for [him]self he went out to the place called Skull Place, the Hebrew name of which is Golgotha. 18 There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on his right and one on his left, with Jesus in the middle. 19 Pilate wrote also a sign and put it on the cross. [It] was written: “Jesus from Nazareth, King of [the] Jews.” 20 Thus many of the Jews read this sign, since the place where Jesus was crucified lay near to the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin and in Greek. 21 But the chief priests of [the] Jews said to Pilate: “Do not write: King of [the] Jews, but that he said: I am King of [the] Jews.” 22 Pilate answered: “What I have written I have written.”
	23 The soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his raiments and made four pieces, one piece for each soldier, and they took also his tunic. But the tunic was without [any] seam [yanwe “joining”], woven as a single piece from top to bottom. 24 Therefore they said, one to the other: “Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots about who will have it” – in order to fulfill the scripture that says: “They parted my robes among themselves, and about my tunic they cast lots.” And the soldiers indeed did so.
	25 [There] stood beside Jesus’ cross his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the mother of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 Thus, when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple that he loved standing there, he said to his mother: “Woman, behold your son!” 27 Then he said to the disciple: “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own house.
	 28 Thereafter, when Jesus saw that everything was [Q: is] completed, he said in order to fulfill the scripture: “I am thirsty.” 29 [There] was there a bowl full of sour wine, and they put a sponge on a spear and brought it to his mouth. 30 After receiving the sour wine, Jesus said: “It is completed!”, and he let his head drop and expired.
	31 Since this happened on the day of Preparation, the Jews requested from Pilate that their legs were to be [Q: will be] broken and the bodies taken away, that they would not remain on the cross on the day of rest, for that day of rest was great. 32 Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and the other who [*yet, dual] were crucified with him. 33 But coming to Jesus they saw that he was [Q: is] dead already and did not break his legs. 34 And yet one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and in the same moment blood and water came out. 35 And [he] who has seen it has witnessed, and his witness is true, and he knows that he is telling true things, that also you will believe. 36 For these things happened to fulfull the scripture: “A single bone of his body will not be broken.” 37 And again, a different scripture says: “They will look at [him] whom they have pierced.”
	38 After these things Joseph from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but in secred for fear of the Jews, made request from Pilate to take away Jesus’ body, and Pilate allowed it. Therefore he came and took his body away. 39 Also Nicodemus, the man who came to him at night in the beginning, came bringing a blend of fragrant resin and eaglewood [a.k.a. aloe], around a hundred pounds. 40 Thus they [-tte, dual] took Jesus’ body and wrapped it in wraps with the fragrant herbs, according to [the] Jews’ custom when they prepare a corpse for the grave. 41 But in the place where he was crucified [there] was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which nobody was yet put [/where nobody had yet been put]. 42 Therefore they put Jesus’ body there, since that was [the] Jews’ day of Preparation, and since the tomb was near.
CHAPTER 20
On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, when [it] was still dark, and she saw that the rock was [Q; is] taken away from the tomb. 3 Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them: “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put him.” 3 Then Peter went forth with the other disciple, and they [-tte, dual] went to the tomb. 4 Both men ran, but the other other disciple ran faster than Peter and came first to the tomb, 5 and he bent and saw the clothes lying there, but he did not enter. 6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and he entered the tomb. He saw the wraps lying there, 7 and the cloth that was on his head, not lying with the wraps, but rolled up in a separate place. 8 Then the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, also entered; and he saw and he believed. 9 For still they did not know the scripture, that [it] was necessary for him to rise from [the] dead. 10 Then the disciples returned to their [-tta, dual] homes.
11 But Mary stood in tears by the tomb. And while her tears poured she bent to look into the tomb, 12 and she saw two angels in white sit [there], one by the head and one by the feet where Jesus’ body had been lying. 13 They [-tte, dual] said to her: “Woman, what is the reason for your tears?” She said to them: “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him.” 14 Saying this, she turned and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that he was [Q: is] Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her: “Woman, what is the reason for your weeping? Whom do you seek?” Supposing that he was the gardener, she said to him: “Lord, if you have carried him away, tell me the place where you have put him, and I will take him away.” 16 Jesus said to her: “Mary!” Turning, she said to him in Hebrew: “Rabboni” – which means teacher. 17 Jesus said to her: “Do not touch me, for I have not yet risen up to my Father. But go to my brothers and say to them: I ascend to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.” Mary Magdalene came and brought the news to the disciples: “I have seen the Lord!”, and that he said these things to her. 
	19 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors were closed where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them: “Peace be to you!” 20 After saying this she showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were happy when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus repeated to them: “Peace be to you!  As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” 22 And after saying this he breathed on them and said to them: “Receive the Holy Spirit! 23 If you forgive peoples’ sins, they are forgiven them; if you retain [tulca- “establish”] peoples’ sins, they are retained.”
	24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 Thus the other disciples said to him: “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them: “If I will not see in his hands the marks of the nails, and I do not put my hand in his side, I will not believe.”
	26 Eight days after this his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, but Jesus came to them and said: “Peace be to you!” 27 Then he said to Thomas: “Put your finger here, and see my hands, and send your hand, and put it in my side; do not be without belief, but believing.” 28 Thomas answered him: “My Lord and my God!” 29 Jesus said to him: “Do you believe because of seeing me? Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe.”
	30 Jesus did also many other signs before the disciples, that are not written in this book; 31 but these are written that you will believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you will have life by his name.
CHAPTER 21
After these things Jesus revealed himself to the disciples by the Sea [of] Tiberias; and he revealed himself thus: 2 [There] were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called the Twin, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples. 3 Simon Peter said to them: “I am going to catch some fishes.” They said to him: “We too are coming with you.” They went out and went into the boat, but through[out] that night they caught nothing.
	4 But when morning came, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not understand that he was Jesus. 5 Then Jesus said to them: “My children, have you not got [any] fishes?” They said to him: “We have not.” 6 He said to them: “Throw the net at the right of the boat and you will find some fishes!” So they threw it, and then they could not draw it up for the multitude of fishes. 7 Therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: “He is the Lord!” Thus Simon Peter, hearing that he was the Lord, bound his jacket around his waist, for he was naked, and threw himself into the sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the boat – for they were not far from land, only around a hundred yards – drawing the net of fishes.
	9 But when they stood off onto land they saw a coal fire lie there and some fishes lying on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them: “Bring some fishes of those you caught now.” 11 Therefore Simon Peter went into the boat and drew the net ashore [nórenna, “to land”], full of a hundred and fifty-three huge fishes. But though they were that many, the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to them: “Come, have breakfast!” No man of the disciples dared to ask him: “Who are you?”, since they knew that he was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and also the fishes. 14 This was the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disiciples after he was raised from [the] dead.
	15 When they had eaten the breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Simon son of John, do you love me more than them?” Peter said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me.” He said to him: “Give food to my lambs.” 16 Again he said to him, a second time: “Simon Peter, do you love me?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me.” He said to him: “Be a shepherd for my sheep!”
	17 He said to him a third time: “Simon son of John, am I dear to you?” Peter had grief because he said to him a third time: “Am I dear to you?” Thus he said to him: “Lord, you know everything; you know that you are dar to me!” Jesus said to him: “Give food to my lambs. 18 Truly, truly I say to you: When you were younger, you bound the belt about yourself and walked where you wished. But when you shall be old, you will reach [out] with your hands and another will bind you and lead you where you do not wish.” 19 This he said to show the kind of death by which he was going to bring glory to God. And after this he said to him: “Follow me.”
	20 When he turned [Q: turned himself], Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus loved follow – the person who at the evening meal was leaning towards his chest and said: “Lord, who is [the one] who betrays you?” 21 Therefore, when Peter saw him, he said to Jesus: “Lord, what will this man do?” 22 Jesus said to him: “If my will is that he will remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!” 23 Therefore this saying went out among the disciples: “That disciple will not die.” But Jesus did not say to him that he will not die, but: “If my will is that he will remain until I come, what is that to you?”
	24 He is the disciple who witnesses about this and who has written these things, and we know that his witness is true. 25 But [there] are also many other things that Jesus has done. If one were to write about every single matter, I suppose that there is not enough place [or, space] in the world itself for the books being written.CHAPTER 1
My first account, glorious Theophilus, I wrote about all the things that Jesus started to do and to teach, 2 until the day when he was taken up, after he gave commands to the apostles that he chose. 2 To them he also showed himself alive with many signs after he suffered, being seen by them through forty days, making known the things that concern God's kingdom. 4 And at his meetings with them he gave them the commands: “Do not go away from Jerusalem, but remain, waiting for that [ta-n] about which the Father gave his promise, and about which you heard from me. 5 For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit not many days from now.”
	Now when they were assembled, they asked him: “Lord, do you renew the kingdom for Israel at this time?” 7 He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times and moments which the Father has placed in his own power, 8 but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit shall come to you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and the entire Judea and Samaria alike, and to the farthest part of the earth.”
	9 And after he said these things, while they were watching, he was being lifted up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes [dual]. 10 And while they looked up into heaven when he went away, behold! two men in white garments stood by them, 11 and they [dual] said: “Men from Galilee, how is [it] that you are standing looking at heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into the cloud, shall return so, in the same manner that you watched him go into heaven.”
	Then they went back into Jerusalem from the mountain called Mount of Olives, which is near to Jerusalem, around a sabbath's journey away. 13 Then, after going inside, they went up into the upper hall where they dwelt, Peter and John and Jacob and Andrew, Philip and Thomas and Matthew, Jacob son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zelot, and Judas son of Jacob. 14 All among them were steadfast in prayer, with some women and Mary mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
	15 Now in those days Peter arose out of the middle of the brothers – the crowd was around hundred and twenty persons – and said: “Men, brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be made true, that which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand through David's mouth about Judas, who showed the way for those that seized Jesus. 17 For he was counted among us and received a part in this ministry.” 18 (This man got a field for the reward of unrighteousness, and falling with a headlong movement he burst in the middle, and all his entrails poured out of him. 19 That became known to all that dwelt in Jerusalem, and therefore that field was called in their tongue Aceldama, which means: Field of Blood.)
	20 “For [it] has been written in the Book of Psalms: 'May his home be empty, and may no one live there', and: 'His place of oversight let another take.' 21 Therefore it is necessary for us to choose one of the men that came together with us through[out] the entire time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out [ettenna, to outside] among us, 22 from the beginning when John was baptizing and until the day when he was received up from us. For a person among them it is necessary to be a witness with us about his resurrection.”
	23 And they led forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who had the nickname Justus, and Matthias. 24 And they prayed and said: “You, Lord who know the hearts of all, make known who you have chosen 25 to receive the ministry and place as apostle which Judas abandoned to go to his own place.” 26 And they threw lots about them, and the lot indicated Matthias, and he was counted among the eleven apostles.
CHAPTER 2 
When the day of the festival of Seven Weeks was come, they were all together in one place, 2 and suddenly [rincinen, lit. 'with a sudden move'] [there] came from heaven a noice as of a blowing violent wind, and they filled the entire house in which they were. 3 And tongues as of fire being distributed appeared to them, and it settled [lit. sat down] on everyone among them. 4 Then all among them were filled with Holy Spirit and began to speak in various tongues, as the Spirit gave to them to talk.
	5 And [there] were in Jerusalem Jews dwelling there, pious men, from every country under heaven. 6 Thus, when this noise occurred, the host assembled and was confused, for everyone aming them heard them speak in his own tongue. 7 They were startled and in wonder, saying: “Behold, all these people that are speaking are from Galilee, no?
8 And yet how is [it] that we are hearing, everyone among us, his own tongue that we are born in? 9 People from Parthea ar Media and Elam, people that dwell in Mesopotamia, Judea and Capadocia, Pontus and Asia, 10 and Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the regions of Libya, near to Cyrene, and [those] that have come from Rome, Jews and converted ones alike, 10 people from Crete and Arabia – we are hearing them speak in our own tongues about God's great deeds!” 12 They were beside themselves with wonder and understood nothing, saying one to the other: “What is this thing?” 13 But others, in mockery against them, said: “They are full of sweet wine!”
	But Peter arose with the twelve and raised his voice and said to them: “Men from Judea and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, may this be known to you, and listen to my sayings: 15 These men are not full of wine as you suppose, for this is the third hour of the day. 16 On the contrary, this is [that] which was spoken though Joel the Prophet: 17 'And in the last days,' God says, 'I will pour [some] of my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will speak like prophets, and your young men will see visions, and  your old men will dream dreams [lit. for your old men [it] will be dreamt with dreams], 18 and also upon my male and female thralls I shall pour [some] of my spirit in those days, and they will speak as prophets. 19 And I will give signs in heaven above you and portents on earth below, blood and fire and mist of smoke; 20 The Sun will become darkness and the Moon will become blood, before the Lord's great and mighty day shall come. 21 And everyone who calls upon [or 'by', -nen] the Lord's name will be saved.
	22 Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus from Nazareth, a man that God put before you with mighty deeds and signs and portents which God did by him in your midst, as you know, 23 this man, as a person given over, by God's firm plan and the knowledge that he had beforehand, you fastened on a cross by the hand of lawless ones and killed him. 24 But God raised him by loosening the bonds of death, for it was not possible for death to keep him. 25 For David says concerning him: 'I always saw the Lord before my eyes, for he is by my right hand, to stop me from being shaken. 26 Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue spoke about great joy. Furthermore, also my flesh will dwell in hope, 27 for you will not abandon my soul in Mandos [/Hades], also you will not allow your faithful one to see a corrupt state. 28 You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy from your face.'
	29 Men, brothers, it is me allowed to speak freely to you about the patriarch David, that he expired and was brought to his grave, and his tomb is among us until this day. 30 Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God gave him a promise about placing on his throne a person of the fruit of his loins, 31 he had foresight and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned in Mandos [= Hades]; furthermore, his flesh did not see a corrupt state. 32 This Jesus God resurrected, about which [fact] all among us are witnesses. 33 Therefore, since he was raised to God's right hand and received the Holy Spirit from his Father by the promise he [= the Father] had given, he poured forth this that you are seeing and you are hearing. 34 For David did not ascend to heaven, but he himself says: 'The Lord said to my lord: Sit by my right hand, 35 until I shall place your enemies as a support for your feet.' 36 Therefore may the entire kin of Israel know that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus that you crucified.”
	37 When they heard that they were cut in their heart, and they said to Peter and to the other apostles: “Men, brothers, what are we to do?” 38 Peter said to them: “Find repentance, and may everyone among you be baptized by the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of Holy Spirit. 39 For for you is the promise, and for your children and for [those] that are far away – all that the Lord our God will call to himself.” 40 And with many other words he witnessed for them and urged them, saying: “Be saved from this perverse generation!” 41 Therefore [those] that received his word were baptized, and on that day around three thousand souls were added. 42 And they were steadfast in the teaching of the apostles and the brotherhood, in the breaking of the bread and in the prayers. 
	43 Fear fell upon everyone, and numerous wonders and signs happened through the apostles. 44 All that believed were together in having everything common, 45 and they sold their goods and the fields that they possessed and distributed the money to all, by anyone's need. 46 And 
day after day they were in the temple, being of one mind, and they broke bread in the houses, eating their food in joy and having a pure heart, 47 praising God and having the grace [or, good will] of the entire people, while every day the Lord was adding to them [those] that were saved.
CHAPTER 3
Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. 2 And a man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried thither, and they put him every day beside the gate of the temple that was called the Beautiful, for him to ask gifts of mercy from those that were going into the temple.
3 When he saw Peter and John going towards the temple, he asked from them gifts of mercy. 4 But Peter, with John, looked at him and said: “Look at us!” 5 Therefore he fixed his eyes on them, thinking that he was going to [Q: will] receive something from them. 6 But Peter said: “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have I give to you: By the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!” 7 And he seized him in his right hand and raised him up. In the same moment his soles [dual] and the joints between foot and leg became firm, 8 and he jumped up and walked, and he went with them into the temple, walking and jumping and praising God. 9 And the entire people saw him walking and praising God. 10 Furthermore, they knew who he was, that he was the man who beforehand sat to receive gifts of mercy by the Fair Gate in the temple, and they were filled with wonder and were beside themselves by [that] which had happened to him.
11 When the man stuck to Peter and John, the entire people, being startled, ran together to them in the place called the Columnade of Solomon.  12 Seeing that, Peter said to the people: “Men of Israel, how is [it] that you are in wonder about this, and what is your reason for looking at us as if by our own power or by our godliness we have caused him to walk? 13 The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has made Jesus his servant glorious, him that you gave over and denied before the face of Pilate, though he wanted to free him. 14 You denied the holy and just [one], and you requested that you were to receive a man who was a murderer, 15 but you killed the Chief of life. But God raised him from [the] dead, of which all among us are witnesses. 16 Therefore, by our faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, him whom you look at and whom you know, and the faith which is through him has given him health before your eyes. 
17 And now, brothers, I know that you did so in lack of knowledge, as your rulers also did. 18 But thus God has made true the things that beforehand he made known through the mouth of all his heralds [= prophets]: that his Christ was going to suffer.
	19 Therefore find repentence and turn yourselves [around]! Then your sins will be wiped away, allowing times of refreshment to come from the face of the Lord. 20 Thus he will send the Christ appointed to you, Jesus, 21 whom it is necessary for heaven to keep until the times of renewal of all things, of which God spoke by the mouth of his holy heralds [/prophets], of old. 22 Indeed Moses said: “The Lord your God will raise [up] among your brothers, like me.
23 Indeed every person who does to listen to that prophet will be destroyed from his people.” 24 And all the prophets, from Samuel to those that followed him – all that have spoken – have also made known these days. 25 You are sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God established with your fathers, saying to Abraham: 'And in your seed all the families of earth will be blessed.' 26 After God raised his Son, to you he first sent him to bless you, by turning everyone away from your wicked deeds.”
CHAPTER 4
While they [dual] talked to the people, the chief priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them, 2 being angry since they instructed the people and made know the resurrection from the dead by Jesus. 3 And they [plural] put their hands on them [dual] and put them in gaol until the following day, for evening had come.
	4 But numerous ones among [those] that heard the word believed. And the number of the men rose as far [or, high] as five thousands.
	5 It happened [lit. came] on the following day that the rulers and the elders and the scribes in Jerusalem assembled, 6 with Annas the chief priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all that were of the kin of the chief priest. 7 After putting them in their midst they asked: “By what power and by whose name did you [dual] do this thing?” 8 Then Peter, full of Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers of the people and elders, 9 if we [dual exclusive] are on this day investigated about a good deed to an ailing man, and you want to know by whom this man has received his health, 10 may it be known to all among you and to the entire people of Israel that it happened by the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, whom you crucified but God raised out of [the] dead. By him this man is standing here before you in health. 
11 This is the rock which was counted as nothing by you that built, which has been made the head of the corner. 12 For [there] is no salvation by anyone else, for also there is not [/neither is there] given [any] other name by which it is necessary for us to be saved.” 
	13 When they saw how freely Peter and John spoke, and knew that they [dual] were unlettered and ordinary men, they were filled with wonder, since they also knew them as people that were with Jesus. 14 When they [pl.] saw the man that stood with them [dual], he who received health, they [pl.] had nothing to say against them [dual]. 15 Therefore, after commanding them to go out from the council, they made a consideration together, 16 saying: “What are we to do to these men? For a sign which people know [about] has happened through them, easy to see to all that dwell in Jerusalem, and it is not possible for us to deny it. 17 But to stop it from being spread more widely in the people, let us rebuke them [dual], that they are not to speak more by this name to anyone.”
18 And after calling them they commanded them that it was necessary for them to completely cease to speak and teach by the name of Jesus. 19 But in answer Peter said to them: “If [/whether] it is just in God's eyes to listen to you and not to God, you judge for yourselves! 20 But we [dual] cannot cease to speak about [the things] that we have seen and we have heard.” 21 After they [pl.] spoke more to them [dual] with sharp words they released them, since they [pl.] did not find a reason for punishing them [dual], and by reason of the people, for all among them gave glory to God about [that] which had happened. 22 For the man on which this sign of healing had happened had [an age of] more than forty years. 
23 And after they [dual] were released they went to their [dual] own and told them about the things which the chief priests and elders had said to them [dual]. 24  Hearing that, with one mind they raised their voice to God and said: “Master, you are [the one] who made heaven and earth and [the things] that are exist in them [dual], 25 and who by Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David our father, your servant: 'How is [it] that nations rise up up and peoples are thinking about empty things? 26 The kings of earth have taken stand and the rulers have assembled as one, against the Lord and against his Christ.' 27 For indeed they assembled in this city, Herod and Pontius Pilate and people of the nations, against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, 28 to do [the things] that by your hand and by your choice you have beforehand established were going to happen. 29 And now, Lord, notice their threats, and allow your servants to speak your word with all boldness, 30 when you reach out with your hand to heal, and when signs and portents happen by the name of your holy servant, Jesus.
31 And after they said the request, the place where they were assembled was being shaken, and everyone among them was filled by the Holy Spirit and spoke God's word with boldness.
	32 Furthermore, the multitude of those that believed had one mind and spirit, and no one among them said about anything that he had that that was his own, but they possessed all things in common [uo: together]. 33 And with great power the apostles gave out their witness about the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and great grace lay upon all among them. 34 Indeed [there] was no one having need among them, for all that had fields or houses sold them and brought the money that they got for the sold things 35 and put that before the feet of the apostles. Then one distributed to everyone was their need was. 36 Thus Joseph, who from the apostles received the nickname Barsabba – which means Son of Comfort – one of the Levites, born at Cyprus, 37 who had a field, sold it and brought the money and put it before the feet of the apostles.
CHAPTER 5
But a man whose name was Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a field that he had 2 and secretly kept a part of the money that he got, as his wife also knew. He brought only a part and put it before the feet of the apostles. 3 But Peter said: “Ananias, how is [it] that Satan has given you boldness to lie to the Holy Spirit and put away for yourself a part of the money that you got for the field? 4 While you possessed it, was it not your own? And after it was sold, could you not still choose what you were going to do? What is your reason for doing such a deed? You have lied, not to men, but to God!” 5 When he heard these words, Ananias fell down and expired. And a great fear came upon all that heard it. 6 But the young men rose up, wrapped him in clothes, and carried him outside to his grave.
	7 After three hours his wife came inside, not knowing [that] which had happened. 8 Peter said to her: “Tell me, did you [dual] sell the field for this sum?” She said: “Yes, that was the sum.” 9 But Peter said to her: “How is [it] that you [dual] were of one mind to test the Lord's spirit? Behold! The feet [dual] of [those] that brought your husband to his grave are [dual] before the door, and they [pl.] will carry you outside.” 10 In the same moment she fell down before Peter's feet [dual] and expired. Whent he young men came inside, they found her dead, and they carried her outside and gave her a grave beside her husband. 11 Therefore great fear came upon the entire congregation and upon all that heard about these things.
	12 Furthermore, through the hands [dual] of the apostles numerous signs and portents happened among the people, and all among them assembled in Solomon's columnade, being of one mind. 13 No one of the others dared to join himself to them, and yet the people praised them.
14 Furthermore, persons that belived in the Lord were added, multitudes of men [ner-li > nelli] and women alike. 15 Therefore they brought the sick ones outside and put them there on small beds and on biers, wishing only that Peter, when he passed by, was going to [Q: will] cast shadow on some people among them. 16 And the multitude from the cities surrounding Jerusalem assembled, carrying sick ones and [those] that were being tormented by unclean spirits, and everyone among them was healed.
	17 But the chief priest and [those] that were with him, the order of the Sadducees that existed then, arose and were filled with envy, 18 and they laid hands [dual] upon the apostles and put them in the city gaol. 19 But in the night the Lord's angel opened the gates of the gaol, brought them outside and said: 20 “Go, and standing in the temple speak to the people all the sayings about this life!” 21 After they heard that, they went at dawn into the temple and taught.
	When the chief priest and [those] that were with him came, they assembled the High Council and the entire council of the sons of Israel, and they sent them to the gaol to bring them. 22 But when the officers came thither, they did not find them in the gaol. After returning they told: 23 “The gaol we found shut with all security, and the guards standing by the doors, but when we opened the gaol we did not find anyone on the inside.” 24 When the captain of the temple and the chief priest alike heard these words, they were uncertain about these things and about what was going to happen because of [-nen] this matter. 25 But a man came and told them: “Behold! The men that you put in the gaol are in the temple, standing and instructing the people!” 26 Then the captain went away with his officers and brought them, but without violence, since they feared [Q; feared from] that the peope would [Q; will] kill them with stones.
27 They brought them and put them before the High Council. And the chief priest said: “We gave you the command: Cease to teach in this name! And yet, behold! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to bring this man's blood upon us!” 29 In answer Peter and the other apostles said: “It is necessary for us to follow God's commands over those of men. 30 The God of your fathers raised [up] Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. 31 God raised him to his right hand as Chief and Saviour, in order to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 32 And we are witnesses about these matters, as is the Holy Spirit, that God gave to [those] that listen to his commands.”
	33 When they heard that, they felt wounded and wished to kill them. 34 But [there] was a man who arose in the High Council, a Pharisee whose name was Gamaliel, a law-teacher dear to the entire people. He commanded: “Lead the men to the outside for a short time.”
35 Then he said to them: “Men of Israel, give heed to yourselves concerning what you want to do to these men. 36 For before these days Theudas arose, saying that he was important, and a number of men, around four hundred, went with him. But he was slain, and all that heeded his commands were scattered and undone. 37 After him Judas from Galilee arose, in the days in which the people was counted, and he drew away some people after himself. And yet that man died, and all that heeded his commands were scattered. 38 And as things stand now, I say to you: Let these men be and do not trouble them, for if this matter or things doing is from men, it will be undone, 39 but if it is from God, you will not be able to undo them. Watch yourselves, that you will not be found fighting against God!”
40 Then they gave heed to what he said. After summoning the apostles they flayed them and commanded them: “Do not speak in the name of Jesus!” Then they allowed them to go.
	41 They, therefore, went away from the High Council in joy, since they were counted worthy to suffer mockery for the sake of the name. 42 And every day, in the temple and in the houses, they did not cease to make known the gospel about Jesus Christ.
CHAPTER 6
But in those days, while the number of disciples rose, the Hellenists were grumbling against the Hebrews, since their widows were not heeded in the daily distribution. 2 Therefore the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples to themselves and said: “It is not good for us to abandon God's word to distribute food at the tables. 3 Therefore, brothers, seek among yourselves seven men that have good witness, full of spirit and wisdom, and we will set them to cover this need, 4 but we will still give yourselves to the praying and to the service of the Word.”
5 And what they said seemed good to the entire multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of Holy Spirit, and Philip and Procorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch, 6 and they put them before the apostles, and after praying they placed their hands on them.
	7 And God's word grew, and the number of the disciples rose quickly in Jerusalem, and a huge crowd of priests subjected themseves [lit. put themselves under] the faith.
	8 But Stephen, full of grace and of power, made mighty signs and portents among the people. 9 But [there] arose some men from the synagogue called [the synagogue] of [the] Freed Ones, and some people that came from Cyrene and Alexandria, to quarrel with Stephen. 10 But they  could not stand against the wisdom and the spirit with which he talked. 11 Then secretly they made some men say: “We have heard him speak blasphemies against Moses and God.”
12 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they fell upon him and seized him, and they brought him into the High Council. 13 And they called lying witnesses, that said: “This man does not cease to speak words against this holy place and against the Law. 14 And we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will throw down this place and will change the customs that we have received from Moses.”
	15 And when all that were sitting in the High Council looked at him, they saw that his face was like an angel's face.
CHAPTER 7
But the chief priest said: “Are these matters so?” 2 He said: “Men, brothers and fathers, hear! The God of Glory showed himself to Abraham our father while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, 3 and he said to him: 'Go away from your land and from your kin and come to the place that I will show you.'
4 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God caused him to move to this land in which you now dwell. 5 And yet he did not give him an heir's part in it, also [/even]not the earth under his foot-sole, but he gave him the promise that he was going to give it to him for him to possess it, and after him to his seed, while he still lacked [any] child. 6 Futhermore, this God said, that his seed was going to dwell like exiles in a foreign nation [or, land/country], and the people were going to make them thralls and were going to cause them affliction, through[out] four hundred years. 7 And 'the country [/nation] for which they will be thralls I shall judge,' said God, 'and thereafter they will go forth and will do service [núromolie: servant-work] for me in this place.' 8 And he gave him a covenant of circumcision, and thus he begat Isaac and circumcized him on the eight day, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve family heads [nossetúri: kin-rulers].
9 And the family heads, full of envy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him, 10 and he delivered him out of all his tribulations and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he put him [in office] to rule Egypt and his entire house. 11 But famine came upon he entire land of Egypt and Canaan, indeed a great tribulation, and our fathers did not find food. 12 But Jacob heard that [there] was food in Egypt, and he sent our fathers the first time. 13 And at the second time Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and Jospeh's kin was made known to Pharaoh. 14 Sending a message, Joseph summoned Jacob his father and all his kin, seventy-five people. 15 Jacob went down into Egypt. And he expired, as did our fathers, 16 and they were brought to Shechem and were put in the tomb that Abraham got from the sons of Hamor for a sum of silver [or, money].
	17 When the time came near for the promise which God made known to Abraham, the people grew and rose to a great number in Egypt, 18 until another king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. 19 He used cunning against our fathers and did evil do them, compelling them to put their babies out, for them to die. 20 At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God, and he was kept for [ter = through] three months in his father's house. 21 But when he was put outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and raised him as her own son. 22 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of Egypt, and he was mighty in his words and his deeds.
	23 When he had [an age of] forty years, [it] came into his heart that he would look to his brothers, the sons of Israel. 24 And when he saw a man who suffered injustice, he protected him and gave revenge to the one that suffered violence, by striking down the Egyptian.
22 He supposed that his brothers were going to understand that God would [Q: will] give them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand it. 26 And on the following day he came to them while they fought, and he tried again to bring them together in peace, saying: 'Men, you are brothers! How is [it] that you do injustice one to the other?' 27 But [he] who was injust [unfair, behaving wrong] to his neighbor pushed him away, saying: 'Who made you chief and judge over us [dual]? 28 Perhaps you intend to kill me, like you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' 29 Because of this word Moses ran away and dwelt in the land of Midian, where two sons were born to him.
	30 And when forty years were gone, an angel showed himself to him in the wilderness by Mount Sinai, in the fiery flame of a thorn-bush. 31 When Moses saw it, what he saw filled him with wonder. But when he went near to examine [it], the Lord's voice came: 32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaak and Jacob.' Then trembling seized Moses, and he did not dare to examine [any] further [ambe = more]. 
33 The Lord said to him: 'Take your shoes from [/off] your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground. 34 I have indeed seen the evil done to my people in Egypt, and I have heard their moaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.' 35 This Moses that they turned away, saying: 'Who made you chief or judge?', this man God sent as chief and deliverer alike, by the hand of the angel that showed himself to him in the thornbush. 36 This man led them out after he did signs and portents in Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for [ter = through] forty years.
	37 Thus Moses spoke to the Sons of Israel: 'God will raise [up] for you out of your brothers a prophet like me.' 38 He is [the one] that was among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with your fathers, and he received living sayings to give to us.
39 To his commands our fathers refused to listen, but they pushed him away and turned themselves in their heart to Egypt, 40 saying to Aaron: 'Make for us gods that can go before us! For this Moses, who led us out of Egypt – we do not know what has happened to him.'
	41 Therefore they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and they had joy by the work of their hands. 42 But God turned himself and gave them over to serving the host of heaven, as has been written in the book of the prophets: 'Surely you did not give me gifts and sacrifices for [ter = through] forty years in the wilderness, House of Israel? 43 But you carried the tent of Moloch and the star of Rephan your god, the images that you made to worship them. Therefore I will take you away, beyond Babel [= Babylon].'
	44 Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, like [he] who spoke to Moses commanded that one was to make it, according to the image that Moses saw. 45 And our fathers that received it brought it with Joshua into the land being possessed by the peoples that God threw out before our fathers. There it remained until David's days. 46 He found grace before God and requested that he would [Q: will] give Jacob's God a place for dwelling. 47 But Solomon was [the one] that built him a house. 48 And yet the Highest does not dwell in houses made with hands, like the prophet says: 49 'Heaven is my throne, and earth a support for my feet. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is my place for resting? 50 Or was not my hand what made all these things?'
	51 O thrawn ones, uncircumcized in heart and ears, you always stand against the Holy Spirit; like your fathers, so also you! 52 Who among the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they slew [those] who beforehand made known the coming of the Just One, whom you have now given over and you have slain, 53 you who received the Law as given through angels, but you have not kept it.  
	54 When they heard these things they were cut in their heart, and they ground their teeth against him. 55 But he, full of Holy Spirit, looked into heaven and saw God's glory, and Jesus stand by God's right hand. 56 And he said: “Behold, I see heaven opened, and the Son of Man stand by God's right hand.” 57 But they cried with a mighty voice and stopped their ears, and they went rushing together upon him.
58 And after they threw him out of the city they threw stones at him. And the witnesses put away their clothes by a young man whose name was Saul. 59 And they threw stones at Stephen while he was praying and saying: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” 60 Then he fell upon his knees [dual] and cried with a loud voice: “Lord, do not count this sin against them!” And after saying that, he expired.
CHAPTER 8
Saul assented to the murder of him. 
	On that day a great persecution arose against the congregation which was in Jerusalem; all except the apostles were scattered through[out] the regions of Judea and Samaria. 2 But some men who feared God carried Stephen to his grave, and they made a great lamentation for him. 3 But Saul fell upon the congregation in an extremely harsh manner. Going into house after house and dragging outside men and women alike, he threw them into prison.
	4 But those that were scattered went through the land, making known the gospel about the Word. 5 Philip went down into the city of Samaria and made the Christ known to them. 6 With one mind the crowds heeded the things being spoken by Philip while they listened and watched the signs that he did. 7 And there were numerous ones that had unclean spirits [in them], and they went out crying with a mighty voice. Furthermore, many that were lame and impeded were healed. 8 Therefore [there] was much joy in that city.
	9 But [there] was in the city a man called Simon, who beforehand did magic and startled the nation of Samaria, saying about himself that he was a great person. 10 And all among them, from the least to the greatest, gave heed to him and said: “This man is God's power, which is called Great.” 11 Therefore they gave heed to him, since for [ter = through] a long time he had caused them to marvel with his magic. 12 But when they believed the sayings of Philip, who made known God's kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, men and women alike.
13 Also Simon believed, and after being baptized he remained with Philip and was being filled with wonder when he watched the sings and mighy deeds that happened.
	14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had [Q: has] received God's word, they sent Peter and John to them. 15 They [dual] went down and prayed for them [pl.] to receive Holy Spirit. 16 For still it had not fallen upon them, but they were solely baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 17 Then they [dual] put their hands on them [pl.], and they [pl.] received Holy Spirit.
	18 Now when Simon saw how the spirit was being given by putting hands [on people], he put silver-pieces before them, 19 saying: “Give also to me this power, that anyone on whom I put my hands will receive Holy Spirit.” 20 But Peter said to him: “May your silver and you be destroyed together, since you thought that you were going to possess God's gift for money!”
21 You do not have a part or a portion in this matter, for your heart is not straight before God. 22 Therefore find repentance concerning this wickedness, and ask of the Lord that your heart's thought will be forgiven you, 23 for I see that you are a poisonous gall and a bond of unrighteousness.” 24 In answer Simon said: “You make request of the Lord for me, to stop the things of which you spoke from coming upon me.”
	25 Thus, after they gave a full witness and speaking the Lord's word, they returned to Jerusalem, and they made the gospel known in numerous villages of the Samareans.
	26 But the Lord's angel spoke to Philip, saying: “Rise and go southwards to the road that goes down from Jerusalem into Gaza.” That is in the wilderness.
27 And he arose and went, and behold! there came a minister [arandur, king's servant] from Ethiopia, a mighty man under Candace, queen of the people of Ethiopia. He had gone to Jerusalem to give worship, 28 but he returned and sat in his cart reading Isaiah the prophet. 29 And the Spirit said to Philip: “Go near to the cart and stick to it!” 30 Philip ran beside it and heard him read Isaiah the prophet, and he said: “Do you truly understand what you read?” 31 He said: “How will it be possible for me to understand when I lack anyone who will show me what it means?” And he requested of Philip to come into the cart to sit with him. 33 But the part of the scripture that he read was this: “Like a sheep he was being brought to the slaughter, and like a lamb that is voiceless before [the one] ho cuts off its wool, he did not open his mouth. 33 In his humiliation the judgement was taken away from him. About his generation who will tell? For his life has been taken away from earth.”
	34 In answer the minister said: “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this? About himself or about another person?” 35 Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture he made known to him the gospel about Jesus. 36 Now while they [dual] went on the road, they came to a place where [there] was water, and the minister said: “Look, water! What stops me form being baptized?” 37 Philip answered: “If you believe with all your heart, that can happen.” 38 And he commanded the cart to halt, and both went into the water, Philip and the minister together, and he baptized him. 39 After they [dual] came up form the water, the Lord's spirit quickly led Philip away, and the miniser did not see him [any]more, and he went on his road in joy. 40 But Philip was found in Asoto [Azotus, Ashdod], and he went through the region and made the gospel known to all the cities until he reached Caesarea.
CHAPTER 9
But Paul, still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the chief priest and asked him for letters [lit. asked from him messages] for the synagogues in Damascus, for him to bring bound to Jerusalem anyone that he found was of the Way, men and women alike.
	3 On his journey, when was coming near to Damascus, suddenly [there] shone around him a light from heaven, 4 and after falling to the ground he heard a voice say to him: “Saul, Saul, what is your reason for persecuting me?” 5 He said: “Who are you, Lord?” He said: “I [am] Jesus, whom you persecute! 6 But rise and come into the city, and [that] which is necessary for you to do will be told to you.”
	7 The men that went with him stood dumb, for they heard the voice, but did not see anyone. 8 But Saul arose from the ground, and though his eyes were open he saw nothing. Therefore they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9 And for three days he saw nothing, and he did not eat or drink.
10 [There] was in Damascus a disciple whose name was Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision: “Ananias!” He said: “Here I am, Lord.” 11 The Lord said to him: “Rise, go to the street called Straigth, and in the house of Judas seek a man called Saul, from Tarsus. For look! he is praying, 12 and he has seen in a vision a man called Ananias come in and put his hands on him, for him to see again.” 12 But Ananias answered: “Lord, I have heard from numerous ones about this man, about all the evil things that he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem. 14 And here he has received power from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.” 15 But the Lord said to him: “Go, for this man is for me a chosen tool, to bear my name to the nations and to kings and to [the] sons of Israel alike. 16 For I will show him everything that it is necessary for him to suffer for my name.”
	17 Then Ananias went, and he came into the house, and he put his hands on him and said: “Saul, brother – the Lord, the Jesus that showed himself to you on the road on which you came, has sent me for your to see again and for you to be filled with Holy Spirit.” 18 And in the same moment [there] fell from his eyes [dual] what seemed like shells, and he could again see, and he arose and was baptized. 19 Then he ate and was strengthened.
	For some days he remained with the disciples in Damascus, 20 and without waiting he made Jesus known in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 21 But all that heard him were filled with wonder and said: “Is this man not [the one] who in Jerusalem destroyed all that call on this name, and who came here for the purpose that he was going to lead them bound to the chief priests? 22 But Saul was being strengthened, and he made the Jesus that dwelt in Damascus wholly confused by showing that Jesus is the Christ.
	23 After a sufficient number of days the Jews made a consideration together, about how they were going to destroy him. 24 But their plan against him became known to Paul. But they also watched the gates closely, day and night alike, to destroy him. 25 Therefore his disciples took him and sent him down by rope in a basket through a hole in the wall.
	26 When he came to Jerusalem he tried to join [lit. unite himself to] the disciples, but all feared him, since they did not believe that he was a disciple. 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he told them everything about how in on the road he saw the Lord, and that he spoke to him, and how in Damascus he spoke with boldness in Jesus' name. 28 And he remained with them, going in and out in Jerusalem, speaking with boldness in the Lord's name, 29 talking and quarreling with the Jews that spoke Greek. But they made plans to destroy him. 30 When the brothers perceived that, they brought him to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
	31 Now the congregation in all of Judea and Galilee had peace and was being built up, and while they walked in fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, their number rose.
	32 Now when Peter went through all regions he came down also to the holy ones that dwelt in Lydda. 33 There he found a man called Aeneas, who had lain on his bier for eight years, since he was lame. 34 And Peter said to him: “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and arrange your bed!” And he arose in the same moment. 35 And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
	36 But in Joppa there was a female disiciple whose name was Tabitha, which means Dorcas [= Gazelle]. She was full of good deeds and gifts of mercy that she did. 37 But in those days she became ill and died. They washed her and put her in the upper room. 38 Since Lydda was near to Joppa, when the disciples heard that Peter was in that city they sent two men to him to request of him: “Do not be late in coming to us!” 39 They Peter arose and went with them. And when he came thither, they led him into the upper room, and all the widows stood with him in tears, showing him many tunics and cloaks that Dorcas made while she was still with them. 40 But Peter sent all outside, fell upon his knees and prayed. Then, after turning [Q: turning himself] to the body, he said: “Tabitha, rise!” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. 41 Peter gave her his hand and raised her [up], and he called the holy ones and the widows and put her before them alive.
	42 This matter became known to all in Joppa, and numerous ones believed in the Lord. 43 For a sufficient number of days he remained in Joppa with a man called Simon, a leather-worker.
CHAPTER 10
There was a man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the army division [hosse-ranta] called the Italian, 2 who was reverent and feared God with his entire family, and he gave many gifts of mercy to the people and was praying to God always. 3 Around the ninth hour he saw in a vision an angel of God come inside to him and saying to him: “Cornelius!” 4 The man looked at him, and being frightened he said: “What do you want, Lord?” He said to him: “Your prayers and your gifts of mercy have ascended like a reminder before God. 5 And now, send some men to Joppa and call a person called Simon, who has the nickname Peter. 6 This man dwells in [the] house of a man whose name is Simon, a leather-worker, who has his house by the sea.”
	7 After the angel who spoke to him went away, he called two of the servants of his house and a reverent soldier from among those that remained with him, 8 and he told them everything and sent them to Joppa.
	9 On the following day, when they were on their journey and were coming near to the city, Peter went up to the roof around the sixth hour, in order to pray. 10 But he was hungry and wanted to eat. While they prepared, he went into a vision 11 and saw heaven opened and some kind of vessel that came down like  a huge sheet of linen, 12 and in it [there] were all kinds of four-legged [beasts] and creeping things and birds of heaven. 13 And a voice came to him: “Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!” 14 But Peter said: “By no means, Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean have I ever eaten!”
15 And the voice said to him a second time: “Do not call defiled [the things] that God has cleansed!” 16 This happened a third time, and then the vessel was taken into heaven.
	17 While Peter was still very uncertain about what the vision that he had seen signified, behold! the men sent by Cornelius stood before the gate after asking their way to the house of Simon. 18 While Peter thought about the vision, the spirit said: “Behold! Three men are seeking you. 20 But go down and follow them, and do not be uncertain about anything, for I have sent them.” 21 Thus Peter went down and said to the men: “Behold, I am [the one] that you are seeking. What is your reason for coming here?”
22 They said: “Cornelius the centurion, a man just and reverent, of whom the whole nation of [the] Jews speak well, has received a command through a holy angel about sending for you, for you to come to his house and for him to hear your sayings.” 23 Then he requested of them to come inside, and he received them as guests.
	On the following day he arose and went with them, and some of the brothers in Joppa went with him. 24 One [24-hour] day thereafter he went into Caesarea. Cornelius, waiting for their coming, beforehand called together the people of his family and his close friends. 25 When Peter went inside, Cornelius met him, fell down before his feet and gave him worship. 26 But Peter raised him [up], saying: “Rise; I as well am a man!” 27 And while he was speaking with him, he entered and found numerous people assembled. 
28 And he said to them: “You know well how to a Jew [it] is wholly against the Law to unite himself to a person of another nation, or to go into his house. And yet God showed me that I am not to call anyone defiled or unclean. 29 Therefore I indeed came, without speaking against your calling when I was being summoned. Therefore I ask: What is your reason for sending to me?”
	30 And Cornelius said: “Four days ago, counting from this hour, I prayed in my house when behold! a man with bright garment stood before me 31 and said: “Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God. 32 Therefore send to Joppa and call [for] Simon, who has the nickname Peter. This man is a guest in the house of another Simon, a leather-worker, by the sea.” 32 Therefore in the same hour I sent [people] to you, and you did well by coming here. And so in this hour all among us are here before God, to hear all the things that the Lord has commanded you to say.”
	34 Then Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I perceive that God does not heed faces [= is not partial], 35 but from every nation he receives well the person that fears him and does righteousness. 36 He sent the word to [the] sons of Israel to make known to them the gospel of peace through Jesus Chrsit; he is Lord of all. 37 You know the saying that went through the entire Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism about which John talked – 38 about Jesus from Nazareth, how God annointed him with Holy Spirit and with power, and he went through the land, doing good deeds and healing all upon which the Devil's power lay heavy, for God was with him. 39 And all among us are witnesses of the things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem alike, but they also killed him by hanging him on a tree. 40 Him God raised on the third day and allowed him to show himself, 
41 not to the entire people, but to witnesses chosen by God – to us, that ate and drank with him after his raising from [the] dead. 42 And he commanded us to make known to the people, and to give them witness, that this man was [the one] whom God has placed as judge of living ones and dead ones. 43 About him all the Prophets spoke – that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins by his name.”
	44 While Peter still was still speaking about these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all that heard the word. 45 And the faithful that had come with Peter, those that were of the circumcision, were filled with wonder since the gift of Holy Spirit was poured [out] also upon non-Jews. 46 And they heard them speak in tongues and praise God. Then Peter said: “Can anyone deny them the water, to stop from being baptized these men that have received the same Holy Spirit that we as well have received?” 48 And he commanded them to be baptized by the name of Jesus Christ. Then they requested of him that he would remain with them for [ter, through] some days.
CHAPTER 11
Now the apostles and the brother that were in Judea heard that some non-Jews also received God's word. 2 But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the people of circumcision quarreled with him, 3 saying that he had gone [Q: went] into the house of men that were not circumcized and had eaten [Q: ate] with them. 4 Then Peter began to tell them everything as it had happened, saying:
	“I was in Joppa city when I saw a vision, a kind of vessel that came down like a huge sheet of linen, being sent down from heaven by its four corners, and it came near to me. 6 Looking into it I watched and saw the four-legged creatures of earth and the wild beasts and the creeping things and the birds of heaven. 7 I also heard a voice say to me: Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!
8 But I said: By no means, Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean has ever come into my mouth! 9 A second time the voice from heaven answered: Do not call unclean [the things] that God has cleansed! 10 This happened a third time, and everthing was drawn back into heaven. 11 And behold! in that moment three men stood by the house that we were in, for they were sent from Caesarea to me. 12 Therefore the spirit commanded me to go with them, not being uncertain about anything. But these six brothers also went with me, and we went into the man's house. 13 He told us how he saw the angel stand in his house, saying: Send some men to Joppa and summon Simon who has the nick-name Peter, 14 and he will speak to you sayings by which you will be saved, you and your family. 15 But when I began to speak, the spirit fell upon them just as it fell also upon us in the beginning.
16 Then I recalled the Lord's saying, how he said: John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit. 17 Therefore, if God gave the same gift to them as to ourselves that have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who am I, that I will be able to stop God?”
	18 Now when they heard these things, they said nothing more against him, and they gave glory to God, saying: “Then God has indeed given repentance leading to life also to non-Jews.”
	19 Therefore [those] that were scattered by the tribulation that arose concerning Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, but they spoke the word only to the Jews. 20 But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene that came to Antioch and talked about the gospel of the Lord Jesus also to [those] that spoke Greek. 21 Furthermore, the Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned themselves to the Lord. 
	22 The story about them came to the ears [dual] of the congregation which was in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch. 23 When he came there and saw God's grace, he had joy and urged them sincerely to remain in God's will, 24 for he was a good man and full of Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great crowd was added to the Lord. 25 Then he went away to Tarsus to seek Saul, 26 and after he found him, he led him to Antioch. Thus it came [about] that for a full year they [dual] assembled with them in the congregation and taught a huge crowd, and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians [Hristonduri, Christ-servants].
	27 In those days [there] came prophets down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 One among them, whose name was Agabus, arose and made known by the Spirit that [there] was going to come a great famine upon the entire world. That indeed came in the days of Claudius. 29 Therefore [those] that had more than their need chose to send assistance [mána: a boon] to the brothers that were in Judea. 30 And so they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
